I have been in the market for a great vacuum for quite some time. I have had many vacuums in the shop but nothing ever seemed to hold up and was noisy. I do some woodworking and also always needing a great vacuum to clean vehicles with. I would wash cars and drive them into the garage only to find a puddle of water on the floor. So now I have the right tool for the job. I was a little disappointed at first when I called the Stihl dealer and they said they had one left. I got there to make a purchase and they wheeled it out and had dust and dirt all over it like it had been sitting in the back for a few years. After I got it home and cleaned it up my wife wanted to use it in the home. It worked wonderful... She liked it better in the home then our regular sweeper. I looked on youtube and couldn\'t find any reviews on it. I really must say it was a little pricey but you get what you pay for a great quality sweeper that always comes in handy when you need it. I also purchased the car cleaning kit which I must say was really heavy duty. If your the type of person that does woodworking or auto detailing this is a must have. One thing they did tell me at the Stihl dealer was once I get down to a few bags make sure I call and reorder because its something they do not stock but can have as little as the next day. Also the sweeper bags are really heavy duty I noticed its like a real cloth bag not one of those paper bags and a stainless steel sweeper head and handle that can get under just about anything. The length of the hose and cord is just an added extra this thing can go anywhere and when you don\'t need it too its got lockable wheels. Hope this helps you decide on your purchase. It was well worth the extra money last sweeper I ever need to buy. I will suck the carpet off the floor."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Having over a dozen saws, blowers, and edgers, it was an easy answer to order this one. Using this for over a year, and still find it a quiet workhorse.\\nThe biggest drawback is no local dealers are stocking this, nor the bags. Just need to keep ahead of our needs on the bags.\\nWe are planning on adding a second one this year. Would even buy a third with more work.\\nThe tool reservoir would be better, if deeper. Ours goes out on the jobs, and tools are easy to fall out. When you wrap the hose around the machine for transport, it flexes tight where it comes out of the canister. Thought this might cause a problem as it gets older, but always stays fully open when on.\\nA real pleasure!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I\'ve owned several shop vacuums over the past twenty years. This is my first Stihl. I read the reviews before I decided to purchase. I own Stihl trimmers, chain saws, blowers, pole saw, etc. so when I read the great reviews I decided to purchase the SE 122.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had to contact six dealers until I found one that had an SE 122 in stock. We opened the box and I immediately recognized Stihl quality. Even the way it rolls on the casters is Stihl quality. I took it home, read the manual, assembled the remaining pieces and began cleaning up my small garage wood shop. It worked well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manual says that the vac can be used for dry pick up without the filter bag. That is how I am using it. I\'ve not noticed any dust coming out of the vac.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe filter cleaning button is a great idea. I\'m hopeful that it continues to work as well as it did the first time. Compared with other vacs where you have to blow out the filter with compressed air, this will save a lot of time, keep the filter clean and hopefully the filter will last longer than they did in my other vacs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe metal handle works very well. The plastic handles on my other vacs can fall apart when you are vacuuming the floor and pull on them. The Stihl handles are will designed and stay together.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wish that Stihl made an adapter that would allow me to connect the SE 122 to the exhaust ports on my smaller wood working tools; chop saw, belt sander and biscuit tool. Something that would snap into the end of the Stihl hose would be great. I would purchase one for each of these tools, fit it onto the tool and then snap the Stihl hose onto the adapter when I am using the tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hose is very flexible and appears to be very rugged. I used the vac to clean my Jeep Wrangler. I was impressed with how flexible and sturdy the hose is. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe on board tool and cord storage is will thought out.

When it came into my local dealer I was impressed with the quality of the unit, the low noise level was very important, with a sturdy flexible hose, and great maneuverability. For vacuuming up dust in the barn, I purchased a 7 foot hose because the 10 foot hose is too awkward. \\r\\n After about an hour, it does get warmer around the top of the unit parallel to the lid locks. Now the SE62 that I got 2 weeks later is not as good. I got worried because after 35 minutes of use, it felt very hot around the top of the unit parallel to the lid locks. I had to open up the suction control on the hose nozzle to continue working. I then got concerned so I shut it down, and grabbed my trusty SE122. \\r\\n The SE122 is very flexible. I use a 35mm to 32mm (1 1/2\\" to 1 1/4\\") hose adapter on the stainless steel hose nozzle, attach my 1 1/4\\" telescope wand and can use my regular Dyson dusting tools.

When line advancing became an issue with the new assembly, I disassembled and inspected the mowing head/spool assembly and found significant accumulations of grass, dirt, etc. After spraying out the assembly with water (air would probably work as well), line advancement functioned properly. The following process has proved to make restringing less difficult (not easy but less difficult) and line advancing work properly.\\n\\n1. Loosen the cap (lock nut) and remove the mowing head/spool from the shaft. Note: Over time, the shaft may rust increasing the difficulty in removing the mowing head. This can be corrected by using a wire wheel to remove rust from the shaft after the head is removed.\\n2. Remove the spool from the mowing head.\\n3. Rinse any accumulated grass, dirt, etc. from the inside of the mowing head, especially on the bottom surface where the spool rotates.\\n4.

Push the two sections of line through the two mowing head openings and just into the spool openings. Note: If the line is pushed into the spool too far, it will be difficult to turn the spool and wind the line.\\n9. Turn the spool clockwise inside the mowing head until only ~ 4 inches of each line sticks out the mowing head.\\n10. Place the mowing head/spool assembly back on the shaft noting the mowing head must seat completely on the six-sided nut at the base of the shaft.\\n11.

Net: It\'s hard to load and jams almost every time you try to advance the line. I spend way more time manually opening and fixing the line spool than using the unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that the build quality of the rest of the unit appears to be so good only adds to the frustration. It is amazing to me that this product could ever pass Stiihl\'s quality control process. At the end of the day, I bought what appears to be a very high quality electric tool that would probably run for many years. Unfortunately, because they cut corners on a critical part--and one that is EXTREMELY LOW COST compared to the cost of the other components--what I have is a unit that is unusable. Unfortunately, it was way past the warranty time before I used it, so I can\'t return it."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"I would rather have a root canal then face restring this trimmer.

Twice I have taken this unit back to the dealer I purchased it from, and they said there was no problem. I didn\'t think the folks at the dealership were really interested in solving the problem I was having with the feed.

It took care of what I needed to do, then I thought I would give the FSE 60 another shot. Again, I spent more time trying to get the string to feed--it would not. And trying to dismantle the string head was not what I would call user friendly. Another thing I noticed--not just Stihl, but my old one, is that they are not left hand friendly either.

The only criticism I have of this weedeater is that about a month ago it started running unevenly at full throttle and had severe loss of power. We changed the spark plug and cleaned the air filter but it still wasn\'t right. Took it to Herbert\'s and it turned out to be a spark arrestor screen in the muffler that plugged up with carbon.

I mainly use it for edging, rotating the handle so that it trims vertically.

I suspect that a stright shaft trimmer would have been a better choice. I intially had a problem with the bump and feed feature of the autocut head. The major problem turned out to be that the string was welding itself to the spool. I found out that there is a problem common in string trimmers of ultrasonic heating. I am not familiar with this phenomena even though I spent a number years as an engineer working with designs involving heat transfer. I wish the user manual had warned me about it. One thing that apparently aggravates this is the strung slapping on a concrete sidewalk or driveway when using it as an edger. I have been carefull that the string hits between the sidewalk and the turf. It has now been working like a charm (being sure that I am running at full throttle while bumping and that the string does not get too short).

Because of the clutch, the Stihl requires a much higher RPM to engage the clutch and thereby uses more fuel. More fuel equals more pollution and greater operating cost. Consider making the clutch an option. If the clutch is there to “protect” me, I don’t need it; I’m an adult and fully capable of being responsible for my own actions. For 15 years, I successfully used a unit without a clutch and I’m still alive today. If you had a comparable unit without a clutch, I would have bought it.

I really like the motor, the easy start-up, and the balance of the Trimmer. However, I came very close to taking it back to the store I bought it from because of the very large hassle of trying to keep enough trim line out in order to cut weeds. To be specific, the trim line winding on the spool was evidently done by a machine because the line was wedged in between other lines on the spool and had to be pried out to unroll it. Also, in several places on the spool, the line was fused lightly to the spool and I had to physically break it loose. With all of this, the \\"bump\\" advance function of the spool was ineffective. I am glad to say that when I wound new line on the spool, it was working better, so I am hopeful that these problems that I\'ve had won\'t continue. Also, the line on the original and the second spool that I bought, was old and brittle and broke off very easily when I was operating the Trimmer. It doesn\'t do your products much good to put a very good machine out to consumers that is such a pain to operate, due to the spools and trimline, as you have in my case.

That being said, however, I must tell you that there is a flaw in the blade attachment: After replacing the second set of blades, and it was time to replace them a third time, I could not lock the plastic sleeve that houses the hex nut on the end of the shaft, so that I could unscrew the bottom half of the attachment, which is how the blades are replaced.

From new it idled a little low and sometimes cuts off when idling, not fully warmed up, or when stood up to edge with. That issue seemes to have lessened as it was broken in. After about a full season of use it started running a little rough and vibrating some on the gearbox end (commercial use on 6-12 properties per day for 8 months, so equivalent to years on end of homeowner use). Changed filters and plug and it smothed out the engine issue. NOW THE POSITIVE. It has been very reliable: it starts easily every time and has not gone down a single time, (hasn\'t even flooded!) despite lots of heavy use, rough rides in my trimmer rack, and weather exposure. It has plenty of power. I have used it to edge with and to clear some badly neglected overgrown areas and it has handled it all with ease. By no means is this a light weight trimmer, but it isn\'t a back breaker either, it balances well and is comfortable to use, especially considering the power you get. SUMMARY: Doesn\'t run the absolute best, but in fairness that\'s just the reality of modern highly emissions regulated 2 cycle engines and poor quality modern gas.

I’ve never bought a Stihl before so this was a first and you better believe it was worth every bit of $360.02\\r\\nIt has a insane amount of torque and cannot be defeated by the thick weeds!\\r\\nI love the head design and how it requires no tools to rewind the string!\\r\\nStarts very easy and runs strong!\\r\\nThrottle grip is also a great design and is very comfortable and does not make my hands ache after hours of use, also the kill switch is really nice!\\r\\nVery easy access to the valves when needing adjustments! So no need to completely disassemble for simple valve adjustment.\\r\\nPower of a 4 stroke with the ease of just mixing 2 stroke fuel! There is no oil changes just mix the fuel like a 2 stroke!\\r\\nDoesn’t smoke and create a mess around the exhaust.\\r\\nOverall I can’t be happier and this is a very good model! I’m so glad I went with a Stihl and I think I’ll have this for years to come and it’s so comfortable, powerful, convenient that I actually have fun using it!\\r\\nOverall a super machine and I recommend it to anyone! But now I’ll talk about the bad things sad about it\\r\\n#1 the string is hard to load, it’s actually really simple and easy but some people just have a low iq and can’t understand how to put a coin in a vending machine.\\r\\n#2 it’s hard to start, also not true if everything is tuned right, remember they are adjusted by someone at the dealer and if they don’t know what they are doing then that could be the issue but not the trimmer itself.\\r\\n#3 it breaks string all the time, also not true if you use it like you should, I haven’t had a problem with that but I could see that happening if you make the mistake of hitting very hard objects but that’s just not the trimmers fault...more of a users error.\\r\\n#4 it surges at full throttle...kinda but that’s just the rev limiter keeping the engine from getting into the danger zone so there’s nothing to worry about and also it only does that if your pinning it under little or no load.\\r\\n#5 it vibrates, mine has never had a issue with vibration, it’s flawless and super smooth.\\r\\nAnyways I would completely recommend and don’t listen to the loose screws that have no experience with small engines and think that small adjustments needed makes the trimmer a piece of junk, if the carb isn’t adjusted correctly from the factory it’s very easy to have a Stihl guy do it or even yourself.

The Stihl trimmer line that came with it had tiny cuts in it, I assume to make it break easier. It kept breaking off inside the head, I needed a screwdriver to get the cap off to re-thread the line. The head was very complicated, the last double line trimmer I had had a hole in the spool, I simply doubled the line through the hole and wrapped it, the cap came of easily with my fingers. I also had a problem with the throttle linkage sticking, the trigger wouldn\'t pull. I manipulated it several times and it began working. The deflector shield over the head doesn\'t cover enough of the string, small bits of weeds fly up and hit me in the face. I just put a different brand .095 line on the machine that doesn\'t have tiny cuts, I\'m hoping it works better. \\r\\n\\r\\nI definitely like the muffler sound, it\'s not nearly as loud as any other trimmer I\'ve used.

It was a 2-cycle curved shaft. That machine never seemed to run right- but being a new operator, I figured it was me and not the machine. It was a pain to start, would bog down under load and was generally a pain to use. \\r\\n\\r\\n10 years later I finally bit the bullet on a new unit. After researching and talking to some landscapers, decided to go with the bottom of the pro line instead of gambling on a home-owner unit (I don\'t have a very big yard, so may have been fine with a 56 or 70). The 91R was around three (more the 3X what my first one cost) but after just a couple of outings, this unit is definitely worth the extra $$ (so far- hopefully it continues to perform and not crap out in a few months!). Purchasing from a Stihl dealer, I was actually walked through the startup and operation and the unit was started and function tested before I left the store. \\r\\n\\r\\nPros: \\r\\n1. Easy Startup: warm or cold, this unit starts on the first or second pull \\r\\n2. Power: plenty of torque to cut through the thickest grass. I believe this unit will also run a blade for small saplings as well (with an additional \'safety\' upgrade). \\r\\n3. Comfort: I am 5\'10\\"- the straight shaft is FAR more ergonomic and easy-to-handle than the old curved shaft one \\r\\n4. The bump head seems to work pretty well. You do have to be diligent when wrapping the line to ensure it feeds freely when bumped \\r\\n\\r\\nCons: \\r\\n1. Price: Definitely not cheap, time will tell if it is a worthwhile investment \\r\\n2. Heat: This may be a matter of needing to play with the position of the handle, but currently, the forearm of my throttle hand get very close to the hot top of the power unit.. hopefully a non issue once adjusted right \\r\\n3.

It ran fine until yesterday when I used it for the first time this season. Now I\'m having the same Issues.

With several issues such as unable to feather the throttle and hard starting, I decided to cut my losses and get a different unit. After talking to several people at Stihl, this unit is designed to run two speeds, off and full throttle. As a proscaper, we cannot have full throttle all the time. I suggest moving on to the FS94R."},{"tags":["Unreliable","Difficult to Use","Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"Wonderful engine. You\'ll spend your time listening to it, but not much time trimming. The string does not feed and breaks off inside. This requires you to disassemble and re-thread the line by hand. You do this every two minutes and you\'ll need a screwdriver and cutter to do it, which you will drop in the weeds and lose. So if you expect your string trimmer to have a string, this is not the device for you. The mechanism is horrendous. You are intended to bang the thing on the ground with the trigger at full throttle while singing a rap song with colorful lyrics. Doesn\'t work. The few times it does, it digs a divot out of your landscape. I\'ll try some other cutter heads, but its good money after bad. Don\'t expect service from Ace Hardware. Last Stihl product I\'ll purchase. They had to know this thing does not work."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I started using the trimmer trimming the grass on the side of the hill it ran for Miss 10 minutes in the head stopped moving. I had to run it back 40 miles into town to the Rual king after I called them and the manager was rude to me to about getting it fixed. The store took it in and said that when it was assembled the head was not connected to the rod correctly that’s why it broke down"},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"I bought a Stihl because at this point in my life I don\'t have time to waste working on equipment. When I get a chance, I need it to work. I bought a blade when I bought the Stihl because my dad has a small farm and I knew I\'d get in some tougher stuff. I started using the string first. When the string was out, it was a beast. That\'s the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Problem is the line kept retreating into the spool so I had to keep messing with it. So I thought I\'d put on the blade. I read the manual and discovered I didn\'t have all the parts to attach it. I thought it was an oversight. When I got a chance (a few weeks later), I took it back and was told I needed a blade \\"kit\\". The \\"kit\\" was a $16 and change washer and $4 and change nut! Individually priced, but it was a \\"kit\\". Why would they sell me a blade without the \\"kit\\", you might ask. Because they don\'t keep them in stock. They had to order it. I bought this trimmer in the Spring, but it\'ll probably be Fall (or next year) before I know if the blade is any good. Now my new Stihl graces the wall of frustration in my building along side other weed eaters."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Stihl sent me an e-mail asking my to review my purchase since my trimmer (FS 91R) is now one year old, so I decided to oblige them.\\r\\n\\r\\n Before I begin my review, I\'d like to state that I have always heard that Stihl was a top brand for reliability, which is what led me to view their products when I decided to retire my old yard equipment, so I purchased a FS 91R string trimmer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe retailer where I purchased it started it up in the store for me and it ran fine. I drove home, which took about 30 minutes, and I could not get the trimmer to start. I was using the same fuel the dealer had initially started it with, so it wasn\'t a fuel issue. I returned it to the retailer the next day, and they could not get it to run either, so they gave me a brand new one off of the shelf, which is easy to start. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe trimmer is well balanced and works okay most of the time, but there are a few issues. When starting the engine from a cold start, it starts easily by the second or third pull, but after the engine has been running for some time, and I turn it off, it is very difficult to start and requires multiple attempts. In this situation, I typically have to hold the throttle wide open while starting the engine, and even then, it takes several tries before it will run. Once it is running, it is fine. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no choke lever on this machine. It has a rotary knob that you turn to the choke position, and as soon as you apply the slightest bit of throttle, it un-chokes. I would much prefer a manual choke lever. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is difficult to load string onto the trimmer\'s head, and I will soon purchase and aftermarket head for this unit to make it easier to load string. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the amount of money that this trimmer costs, I feel that there are better options that will outperform the FS 91R. I would not recommend purchasing this trimmer."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I have trusted stihl products and loved them,except this trimmer!!!!

I\'ve been a stihl fan for years but unfortunately I blindly made this purchase without heeding the honest advice embedded in the fake reports here. Mine has the classic problems--bogs down under no load and breaks string off right at the feeder hole. The store blames the problems on user error, \\"that\'s the way 4-cycles run\\", and \\"these run better on the premises fuel\\". I had none of these problems with my old FS55 but regretfully when it finally needed a new carb (after 18 years of service) I thought I would spend some real money for a heavy duty machine. I can get okay with the low torque if it ran consistently, but the intermittent bogging down is extremely frustrating and embarrassing when you spend this much money. The argument to use the premixed fuel is complete BS and unacceptable--if I knew that was required I would not have purchased.

If you’re a landscaping professional who uses their trimmer for mowing applications, grab the powerful STIHL FS 91 trimmer. Its bike-handle design adds greater comfort and leverage, thanks to its redesigned rubberized grips. The trimmer also features one touch stop and a simplified starting procedure enabled by the semi-automatic choke lever. Its low-emission engine is paired with a larger fuel tank, delivering 30% longer run times when compared to the FS 90.

The dealer installed the brush knife for me so I was able to start to work immediately on my overgrown back lot. The engine seemed to have a bit of a miss in it for the first 30 min. but then settled in to a steady drone; the brush knife cut through heavy vines & saplings as if they weren’t even there. (They weren’t after this machine got hold of them.) \\r\\nAfter clearing the lot I switched to the string trimmer which worked well for a time but then, I thought, ran out of line way too quickly. I took the head off & opened it up & it was full of line, when I unwound some line I found it to be sticking together as if it were glued. I unwound most of the line, top and bottom, then rewound it back onto the spools. The line then cut and fed perfectly. Seems as if the it had been sitting an awfully long time for the line to adhere to itself like that. I have a large spool of a really good line that I’ll be switching to before using the line trimmer again.\\r\\nAnyway, except for the line situation I am most pleased with the FS91 bike handle trimmer. \\r\\nA word of caution about the brush knife: that thing is SHARP as razor. Wear heavy gloves when changing the blade, I just grazed my thumb against the blade & blood was everywhere.

Nothing in the specs online, or on the shelf\'s at dealers display area. I\'m sure they tell the dealers not to disclose that their products are four stroke now. I should had seen the writing on the wall. Dealer selling points \\"low end torque, and EPA exhaust gas recycle, better gas consumption\\" I like my new fs 91 but I feel like I was tricked into thinking it was a 2 stroke.

The next day when I was ready to try it out for the first time, the motor started but the head would not spin.. I called Atwoods to see if there was a simple fix to resolve my problem and was referred to another store in town (their Stihl tech was not in that day). Upon arrival at Gilfillan\'s their Stihl tech said he saw the problem right away. Turns out the head had been assembled incorrectly. In a few minutes he had my FS 91 working properly and tested then I was on my way. \\r\\n\\r\\nNeedless to say, I love the product and I have a new dealer for all future Stihl purchases and service. Thanks Gilfillan\'s team, y\'all are the BEST!\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the FS 91, it runs well, has a lot of power and meets my needs on a wooded 9 acer property. The only thing that I wish was that it had the same easy start function that my Stihl 211 chainsaw (that I purchased from Gilfillan\'s) has.

All in all it is a great weed trimmer and I am very happy with my purchase."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"I\'d had great hopes for my new FS91. It is powerful, but the string trimmer was worthless and using the brush cutting blade caused so much vibration in my hands and my right hip where the unit rests while using the shoulder strap, that I could only tolerate about 5 minutes of this torture. I installed the blade correctly, despite the direction sheet being terribly confusing. I was hoping to be able to use this trimmer for at least 15 minutes, but just couldn\'t tolerate the pain to my hands."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"First of all, the product is an FS90 - which the review choices say doesn\'t exist? Maybe that\'s part of the problem - I have some sort of expired model. Who knows? Followed the starting instructions to a T and will never start using that procedure. Finally took it back to store, where the guy starts it on first pull. I asked him to show me the procedure before he started - nope, just rips the cord and it starts. Well he did it by holding the throttle wide open. NOWHERE IN THE MANUAL DOES IT SUGGEST THAT. After returning home, the same problem continues - the only way it starts is by holding the throttle wide open - product manual is a joke, or this machine is a lemon. I\'m not sure which."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"With a steel blade it cuts well but the nylon head does not feed without stopping the machine and often the nylon just breaks off so that you have to take it apart and feed out more nylon.

We were expecting the new FS 91 we bought to have the same capabilities as the other ones but it doesn\'t. There is a serious lack of power that doesn\'t compare to the other trimmers of the same model. It runs well but just doesn\'t get the same job done as the other trimmers. We would have purchased a larger engine if we knew this one was weak in power."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I have had this for about a month now and used it about 5 times and not sure whats going on with it. It starts great and idles fine but when you give it throttle it seams to bog down at full throttle. It is worse when the cutting blade is attached. I thought maybe I tightened things to much but I took the blade of and put the sting back on and it would still sputter a high speed. Going to take it in to my local dealer...I hope its just something I\'m doing wrong. I had a friend of mine who bought the same exact brushcutter run it and he said that it doesn\'t run like his."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Purchased it, tried it, returned it!\\r\\nI bought this thinking that it would be more than enough for my 2 acres. However it lacked power and it bogged down and ran rough. Also head trimmer cord kept breaking off inside. When the dealer spooled the cord it did it and when I re-spooled the cord it did the same. Dealer said the cord looked old and brittle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the professional landscaper these are probably small issues which are easily overcome, but for the price I thought it really wasn\'t worth the money. \\r\\n\\r\\nI ended up getting the FS130R (Loop handle) and the brush / saw cutter kit for a few dollars more. Lots of power doing the same job."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I spent 13 hours with this machine and finally returned it to my dealer. (He was extremely polite when honoring my request.) I upgraded to the fs131 at almost the exact same weight. It\'s absolutely worth the extra money, and it comes with the harness."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"My previous 4 stroke trimmer needed some extensive repairs, plus it never really had enough power. The dealer had this and another popular Japanese brand. I ended up buying the Stihl based on reputation and having heard how powerful some being used in my neighborhood were. I should\'ve got the Japanese brand. No where is it mentioned that all the Stihl trimmers are now 4 stroke. I should\'ve done more research, so my fault. It runs good, easy to start but doesn\'t really have much more power than the previous 4 stroke Japanese brand trimmer it replaced and about as much power as my 20 year old with many hours on it 2 stroke Japanese trimmer. Pretty disappointing. It bogs pretty easily in any thicker, wet grass, which is pretty much all the grass I use it on. It doesn\'t rev. Barely any increase from half throttle to full throttle. When the string is new and full length it struggles with just about any decent amount of grass. Only when the string gets worn down and inch or so is it able to cut decent without bogging down really bad. I think it\'s a little deceptive that Stihl doesn\'t come right out and say that they\'re using low power 4 stroke motors. Having to use premix on a 4 stroke kind of eliminates the only real benefit to it being a 4 stroke. It\'s just not worth the price. An inexpensive 2 stroke from from a big box store is going to have more power. And that\'s sad. At least I have a 4 year warranty."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"Within the first week, I had the trimmer head apart 7 times.

The first one I purchased wouldn’t run right out of the box, and the techs that worked on them all the time said they were that way. Hmm… spent all last summer trying to get it right with no luck. Finally got a replacement and it worked well through the break in period and it’s getting worse and worse, using Stijl gas and everything’s clean, but then hey it’s brand new. Very disappointed and won’t fall for it again. I sure would stay away from this product."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"The old fs90 was my go to trimmer. \\r\\nThe new fs91 is basically a Nike shoe box. Bigger, bulkier, and useless. I purchased one about 3 weeks ago. Always use stihl oil for 2.5 gallon mix. I lost power in the second week. Purchased the service kit and it ran fine for another week. I pulled the plug because I lost all power. Looked terrible. 2 plugs in 3 weeks. Not worth my time or efforts to keep it running. \\r\\nNote, this is my second fs91. The first one had constant carburetor issues. \\r\\nI’m done with stihl. \\r\\nI run a landscape company and buy thousands worth of products every year but it will not involve stihl products anymore."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"I have been running one of these for the school all summer and have had nothing but trouble with the feed.We got a new head and got the same results.."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Stihl gives the impression that you are getting a 2 stroke product when in fact it\'s a 4 stroke unit. It is very underpowered and you still have to add oil with the gas. There are virtually no pros in buying into this product unless you are that partial to the Stihl name and the design of the product. Another new overpriced subpar product from Stihl. Made in China assembled in America...Stihl."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I expected a way better performing product from Stihl. I based my purchase almost solely off the volume of these I seem to see landscaping companies using. Overall, I am not impressed with it. It starts pretty reliably but the performance while running is poor. It is really likes to bog until at higher RPM, but once at high speed seems to maintain it well (good HP). I\'ve only operated it about 4-6 hours total and it\'s been that way since day one. Even in the store I tried it and it wasn\'t too impressive but decided on it based off the sales guys pressure. I\'m going to try adjusting some carb screws to see if I can improve the throttle response."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I purchased a new trimmer in Mother\'s Day. It has been used to trim three time now. The first time line feed system worked for less the five minutes. After 30 minute I had stopped 5 times to refeed the line. Thought about returning that day but hardware was already close. Next time I used it. It was not more then five minutes again before the feed system stopped working again. To say the least I am very disappointed with the current Quality of this trimmer. Have a STIHL chain saw and blower both have been excellent products."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"i bought one of these after doing a lot of research on different trimmers and it sounded perfect for my weekly yard work but after taking it home it would not get up to higher end of power and the high end jet was starving it of fuel . so i packed it up and took it right back to my dealer they said the person that is trained on theses would not be there till the next day, they looked at it and gave it back to me tried again and the same problem infarct the weeds slowed it down and killed it, took it back for my money back . now with that said i do have other stilhl products with no problems so im not given up on them, but this one sucks."},{"tags":["Heavy","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"This was the worst investment ever. We had the old style FS90 and they were awesome! Needed a new weed eater so we purchased this. Used it two times was in the shop and had to have a repair done to the engine. Only used a handful of times more and now it needs a completely new engines due to the internal parts made of plastic not lasting. Then Stihl tells us they cannot warranty it because the muffler has rust on it. It is a piece of outdoor power equipment, yet it is so fragile that you should only use it when the weather is absolute perfect. This is a poor excuse for a Stihl product and poor support from STIHL. We purchased the silver bottles of oil to extended our warranty for two more years and now we have a weed eater that looks brand new with two years of warranty left and isnt working.

It held over 4 gallons which was nice, it is lightweight, easy to fill and with the extended wand, did a great job getting into all the spots I needed it do, including climbing roses. I am only 5 feet tall, yet even with the backpack full, I found it easy to use and control (just don\'t bend down!) To get it on, I put the sprayer on a lawn chair, and then fill it. I then sit in the chair and put the straps on and stand up. Works great. It\'s not that heavy, and I consider my spraying time a \'weight bearing workout\'. The pumping is a good exercise for my left arm. I love the freedom to walk around with the sprayer up and down hills without dragging or lifting anything.\\n\\nI did have to repair the hose once, and replace some o-rings, but otherwise it worked great for 7 years. I am now having some issues with the pressure, and since this unit is so old, I will likely purchase a new one.

Decent build quality, with power that can\'t be matched by any sprayer in it\'s price range that i\'ve come across. While it does have it\'s issues, it beats every other pack I\'ve come across for one simple reason, maintenance. While most other packs are designed to be used up and thrown away, the SG 20 can be rebuilt indefinitely as long as you\'ve got the parts. On top of that, the entire pressurizing system is located outside the chemical tank, which allows for tear downs in the field with minimal chemical loss. The system it self is dirt simple, comprised of two valves and a pair of ball bearings, and as anybody who uses a tool day in day out is aware, simplicity always trumps complexity. Any broken parts can be stripped and replaced in no time flat with a wrench and flat head screwdriver, which is especially important when you\'ve got a dead line to reach. As someone who puts in ten to twelve hour days, five to six days a week, seven months out of the year...this pack has become as crucial as my ATV. I used to go through one or two packs in a year, Now I\'m on my forth season with the same unit, and only a hand full of parts replaced."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"This is by far the best back pack sprayer you will ever buy.

These are used an average of 25 hours a week each by two of us. I have one for lawn care products, one for tree, shrub and flower products, and one for non-selective herbicides. So as I said anybody that has something bad to say about these products, abused them, or do not know how to properly used them or maintain them.

I was very disappointed to find that I\'d have to go through a dealer for all replacement parts. Not only that, but I couldn\'t buy just the cracked piece, I would have to buy the whole wand assembly for almost the cost of a whole new complete backpack sprayer.

Basically what this says is I have a good understanding of what quality should be, but also know that Stihl can\'t afford to shoot for the stars with such high quality it puts the company out of business. However, for this particular product, and for the cost, I think Stihl could have gone the extra mile and used steel, aluminum alloy, and or brass sprayer wound, handle, and hose adapters.

Overall, it\'s fairly robust. The pump arm is sturdy, along with the tank. The spray wand feels slightly flimsy, but it hasn\'t been a problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo far the biggest oversight is in the fact that the wand doesn\'t have lock-out feature. I feel this is a substantial problem, as when you need to move from one location to another, it\'s not always practical to relieve pressure from the system. On two occasions the wand lever bumped into something while loading the pack into a vehicle, and in spite of trying to be careful. This resulted in spray on my pants leg and a bit on the trunk liner of my vehicle. I plan on making a lock-out block myself, but this is something that should have been incorporated from the start.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for carrying comfort, it\'s better than a Solo, but still wears on you once you start that third tank full and beyond.

Otherwise sprayer is ok and much easier to use than traditional garden sprayers."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I’ve been in the landscape industry for twenty years, and this is the best sprayer on the market, however, there are some specific weak points in the design that could be easily improved, some of which I have read about in previous reviews, some not, as most reviews aren’t specific. The white plastic nut that connects tank to wand; this fitting should be permanent and NOT a threaded fitting. It will eventually loosen during normal use and expose the operator and will easily break if over tightened. I have never had one of the brass barb fittings with an automotive style clamp fail. Stihl- change this design to a failproof one, the barb fitting. There is another threaded fitting connecting the pump piston to the tank, this one a brass fitting, which is better than plastic, but should be also eliminated in favor of a non threaded barb fitting, as this threaded junction will eventually loosen and leak on the operator during normal operation. So stihl- on the next model, upgrade these fittings to eliminate these leak points.\\r\\nMy next big issue is with the cap, for two reasons; one, during walking or agitation, some chemicals will spurt out of the vent in the cap, often onto the operator, and the cap itself will often leak at the seal with products with extremely low viscosity, like spray adjuvant additives (spreader sticker or methylated seed oil), 2-4D or triclopyr. (Basically, if the spray turns white when mixed with water, be careful! It will easily leak out). I cannot see any reason for the leaking at the cap seal, the o ring appears new and undamaged, no crimping or anything, and the point at which they leak is not apparently constant. I have taken to a thorough three point inspection with each tank I mix to check for leaks before putting the sprayer on my back. The caps perform without issue for some chemicals, but leaks for others. I get the most leakage on the sprayers I use the most, but the two I am having issues with at the moment are 2018 models purchased about six months ago. I would say I use the sprayers almost daily, and spray between 25 and 100 gallons per week through my nonselective tank, but less than 20 gallons per week through my broadleaf tank, so I cannot attribute the leakage to simple wear, it has something to do with the ability of the chemical inside to “escape” the seal.\\r\\nMy suggestion to at least mitigate exposure to the operator during a mild cap leak would be to add a half moon shaped ridge to the tank at the top of the tank below the cap to direct a spill AWAY from the operator, and down the BACK of the spray tank. Also, the top of the tank is not molded incredibly well, and may, in itself be the cause of the leaking, due to improper contact between the o ring and the top of the tank. I use significant amounts of lithium grease to prevent leaks (to the degree it is acting as thread seal), so there is a design flaw here I believe in manufacturing. I say this because it is apparent when the o ring is heavily greased that it contacts the sprayer top at a slight angle, over half to two thirds of the circumference of the cap, leaving lighter pressure along a small portion of the cap. I do not remember an issue with the caps on solo sprayers, though I use the stihls now because they last longer overall when cared well for, and are much more comfortable to use and wear."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"Much more dependable than the other manual pump sprayer.

Also, the wand is too flexible and you have to keep pumping to maintain a fairly decent pressure flow. It comes with only a single (brass) nozzle, which doesn\'t give too fine a spray-a little too course for my taste; many competitors provide 3 or 4 nozzles for different spray patterns, at no additional charge.

As long as you follow the instructions, there isn’t too much you can mess up. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter assembly, I filled it up with water to give it a test run. The unit was watertight after assembly. The pump operated smoothly and did a decent job of keeping up pressure. I believe the manual said that it should be pumped 3-6 times per minute, but I felt like I needed to pump a little more frequently than that. With that said, I was just using water and was not using a dye or indicator to get a high contrast view of how my spray was being applied, so extra pumps could be user error.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as this unit’s construction and design goes, it is almost great. The tank itself is sturdy, and I appreciated the window that indicates the level to which the tank is filled. The frame is a little uncomfortable and old-school.

The frame and straps on this unit are sturdy, but not the most comfortable, especially if you plan on wearing it for long periods. I appreciated the brass nozzle for spraying. The SG 20 comes with a cone patterned nozzle that is adjustable, so you can modify how wide your cone pattern is. I wish the pump would have included a few more tips so I could vary the spray pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\n By far, my least favorite part of the SG 20 is the wand. It feels flimsy and is made of plastic. The wand’s handle is also plastic and feels cheap. The wand is like putting Kia components on a Ferrari. The rest of the SG 20 is good, but the wand does not fit. I’d rather pay a more money for a beefier brass handle and sturdy metal wand that I don’t have to worry about breaking while the unit is stored. I understand that plastic is lighter and easier to use for longer periods of time, but it doesn’t feel durable... unlike the rest of the unit, which is quite sturdy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bought this unit because I have a lot of other Stihl power tools that work really well. I’d buy just about anything with a Stihl motor on it, but I’d pass on this particular unit. If there was a wand upgrade available, I’d change my mind."},{"tags":["Unreliable","Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"ihave owned three of these the first one was great the other two are junk dont buy this as for warranty it doesnt exist contrary to a salesman who told me i had lifetime warranty dont know where to go from here as i need a good sprayer but this aint it"},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I loved this sprayer when I first started using it.

I\'ve used my SG-20 sprayer maybe 15 times, and I\'ve come home with pants stained with blue dye from my herbicide mix at least 5 times now. \\r\\nThe first time I used it I had a blue butt within 20 minutes. The connection where the hose meets the tank was leaking so I realized I had a \\"lemon\\" and took it back to the dealer. They gladly replaced the sprayer with a new one. Problem solved.... however the next time I used the new sprayer I got another blue butt, but this time I had to use it for about 90 minutes before I felt the spray drip down my legs. l told the dealer about the second sprayer and they said, \\"Oh yeah you need to use hose clamps\\"... so I bought two hose clamps and installed those above and below the connections of the hoses to the tank. \\r\\nThe next couple uses I went home with dry pants. My wife was wondering when she could use her new detergent on my pants again so I kept trying. Lo and behold, I managed to get the sprayer to leak even after the hose clamps were installed. It turns out that the white plastic nut that tightens the connection of the hose to the spray tank will eventually loosen up. So now every time I use it I got in the habit of reaching back to tighten the plastic nut with my fingers. That\'s rather annoying, so I stopped using the sprayer and went with other brands. \\r\\nRecently I decided to give the old SG-20 another chance, I filled it with 4 gallons of spray and checked the plastic nut before starting. It took about 5 minutes before I felt that familiar feeling of wetness on the back of my legs, I reached back and sure enough the old plastic nut had loosened again and blue spray mix was squirting everywhere. I think the client I was applying herbicide for was impressed with my ability to fling the backpack off and tighten the nut within seconds, however I managed to get blue spray over much of my butt and legs, and gloves, and all over the vegetation where I was standing when it leaked. \\r\\nSo if you want to impress clients with your ability to stop a leaking sprayer while only getting somewhat stained, this could be the sprayer for you. \\r\\nI wish I had something nice to say about this sprayer (beyond its staining ability) but the straps are uncomfortable, the pump piston needs to be lubricated after every use (something other brands don\'t require), and the brass nozzle puts out a pretty wide cone of spray and doesn\'t allow for a narrow stream.

It\'s big mouth opening makes it simple to pour solution in for spraying. Once full of gas and solution it\'s a little awkward for me to put on,I am 64, I fill it and start it while it is on tail gate of my truck or on a tall table I have,then slide into it.The SR200 is perfect for getting at least 15 feet up in the trees ,Eve\'s of house and across the yard,plenty of power. I go from thousands of mosquitos 1 night to 2 or 3 the next night at most! Best yard investment I could have made . I noticed a few people asking what solution did other people use . I use Bifen I/T and if you mix at 1 ounce per gallon you can get rid of about 75 other types of pests,not for spraying in area with fruits or veggies or any thing you eat.

My philosophy is to buy tools that I can pass on to my sons and this was no exception. I’ve had other pressure washers with comparable specs, but nothing compares to this unit.\\r\\nLet me get into the things I really like about this unit. It’s polished! This isn’t an after thought item created to capture market share, it’s a well crafted machine. Start with the frame, it’s thick tubular construction and large tires jump out at you when you first see this thing in person. I thought the black and yellow brand I had was well made, but this thing is robust. It shouts at you that it’s ready to work. The height of the handle is perfect, no bending over to move the unit. You have no idea how much of a difference that makes for a guy pushing fifty.\\r\\n The second thing that will stand out is the pump. When I bought my last washer I made sure I got a triplex pump, but the pump on this unit makes my last one look anemic. Again, it’s beefy, it’s obvious that it’s a good pump. Are there better pumps? I’m sure there are, but in this price range it’s a standout in my opinion. It has easy to access service points to add and drain the oil with a very large clear sight window to see the oil level.\\r\\nThe next thing I would like to remark on is the vibration mitigation system. I haven’t seen much information on this so let me explain. The Koehler engine is mounted to a steel plate which in turn is mounted to the chassis, however it has big rubber spacers between the chassis and engine which make it essentially float. It’s brilliant! My black and yellow unit would vibrate all the way down the driveway, but the Stihl stays exactly where you park it. No more rubber skid marks on the driveway like my old unit.\\r\\nThe wand is great too with the added free floating and lockable perpendicular handle. It’s so easy to switch hands and flip the handle over. This is a feature my last unit did not have and I’ll never get another gun without this feature. The hose is steel braided and quality. It’s only forty feet, but I realized that it’s easier to roll up than my old 75 foot hose. The bracket to hang the hose is hands down better than any other unit I’ve had. It’s in a logical place, does exactly what it’s supposed to do and the hose never falls off in transport.\\r\\nFinally let’s talk about performance. The Koehler engine never misses a beat. It never even hints at a struggle unlike my black and yellow unit with the Honda engine. Don’t get me wrong, I love Honda engines, in fact I prefer them, but my last unit seemed to struggle when it got going full stream. This Koehler doesn’t seem to have any trouble keeping up with the work load. It increases RPMs when I apply load and it slows down when I take away the load. There is no hesitation it works flawlessly in my opinion. My last unit would have times when I started to work after bleeding the air where it would just stop pushing out water. I had two of those units and they both did the same thing. I don’t know what that was, but I’m so glad this unit does not do that. I bleed the air, Fire it up, and it starts blasting away.\\r\\nI can not say enough about this machine. It’s everything I hope my last pressure washers would have been. It was hard for me to spend that kind of money for the Stihl, but I am so thankful I did because it’s exactly what I’ve come to expect from this brand.\\r\\nI wasn’t a Stihl snob until my other orange equipment started to wear out and I bought my first Stihl. My experience has been that Stihl will give me the peace of mind that I’m looking for with every purchase. That isn’t to say that there aren’t other great brands out there. I’m Polish which makes me stubborn and fiercely loyal. Stihl has earned my loyalty. I now have three Stihl machines and each was a marked improvement over the unit they replaced. Not just a little better, a lot better. I’d Like to think that in 10 years or so, my oldest son will have his first home and I can buy him his first Stihl to start him off right and continue this tradition."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Reliable"],"reviewText":"Just bought this product this week.

First, I looked at the engine. This Kohler engine is the COMMAND PRO CH270... and that’s a good thing. If you have researched Kohler engines then you know that Kohler makes another line of engines that doesn’t share the same positive reviews that the COMMAND line does. Once I realized I was good to go on the engine I then moved on to researching the pump.\\r\\n\\r\\nI couldn’t find the pump brand for the RB600 listed ANYWHERE on the internet or in the product manual I read before making my decision so I called Stihl and asked them for the pump manufacturers name. Well, the nice guy I was transferred to didn’t know the name and said, “I think that one is made in Italy” Ha! He was thinking this is an AR pump but it isn’t. The AR pump is on the RB800. I went down to the dealer, took pictures of the pump with my phone and started researching based on photos. This triplex pump is made by Mi-T-M. I started researching Mi-T-M pumps and felt comfortable with their quality. On a side note, researching pressure washer pumps will give you a headache. There are so many positive and negative reviews that it’s hard to sort through what’s important and what isn’t....But I digress \\r\\n\\r\\nNow that I felt comfortable with the engine and pump I then moved on to what actually made me choose this model over less expensive pressure washers. The cart. This cart is fantastic. It’s tall, easy to maneuver and rock solid. The handle folds down for compact storage as well. The large tires allowed me to roll the washer all over my grass with little to no effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy previous homeowner pressure washers had hose attachments in areas and on angles that caused me to trip over the hoses when moving the cart from point A to point B. The RB600 solved this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt started on 1st or 2nd pull every time including when hot. The 3GPM was plenty of flow for washing my house yesterday. The 3200 PSI is enough for anything I will encounter at my house.... maybe a little too much in some cases but there is an ability to dial down the pressure. The 40ft hose is high quality and long enough for my needs. I did purchase the 33” lance and pivoting coupler to make washing the house a little easier. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe ONLY question I still have is if this is a downstream chemical injector or not. I called Stihl and asked them and Stihl told me that it IS a downstream injector but the manual clearly states that the chemical will be mixed inside the pump.,. So which is it? If it is a downstream injector then what is the ratio? 8:1, 10:1, 16:1? If this is a typo in the manual then Stihl needs to change the manual to reflect that this is a downstream chemical injector and state the mixture ratio."},{"tags":["Easy to Maintain","Easy to Use","Reliable"],"reviewText":"This is a great machine and is easy to use.

The RB600 has been a good tool. Easy for anyone in the family to operate. The large tires manage our rock yard well, and the washer has good power and reliability. A few smaller changes are needed for such an expensive tool - 1. Make the lance longer, like the RB800 has and 2. Divert the water at the pump outlet so you can confirm water flow before starting. Our favorite accessory is the pivot coupler - great for washing under something. Worst accessory was the water broom - didn\'t really work for us.

COULD NOT get it started. Went back and double checked all instructions from the Stihl engine literature. Returned it to dealer 25 miles away. Started fine there. When I told them what I was doing they said that was my problem. Apparently the literature enclosed is either wrong or the wrong information for that engine. It says to set the choke in the start position for a cold start and let it run then gradually move the choke to the run position. The service shop said that is wrong. You should never leave it in the choke position!\\r\\nOkay, fine. I brought it home and followed the advice and tried to start it.

Never let the washer run for more 2 minutes without spraying or you will destroy the engine. 2. Only apply soap with the largest nozzle. 3. After applying soap let it set but DO NOT let it dry on the surface before you use a smaller nozzle!\\r\\nSo, here we go. Apply soap over a relatively small area so you don\'t let it dry, with the large nozzle, remove the large nozzle and inset a smaller one. Did you drop one of them? Now your getting close to the 2 minute warning. Shut the washer down, change nozzles and hope the soap on the wall is still wet. Restart washer, (11 pulls), don\'t forget to pull the detergent \\"kit\\" out of the bottle all while stepping over and around your supply hose and pressure hose that insists on coiling it self.\\r\\nMultiply your fun if you have reposition ladders or hoses.\\r\\nWhere on earth does the term \\"Easy Starting\\" fit in this picture?"},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"The Pleasure washer is designed such that the hose will inevitably touch the muffler... if you want this get ready to buy a 10-pack if Howe’s from Costco. \\r\\n\\r\\nThey say they will warranty the hose but no Stihl dealer has them in stock.

This machine is perfect for the homeowner that has small to bigger jobs around your property. The performance is great, yet the best feature is it\'s small compact size. It\'s basically Plug and Play. Two different spray heads that can handle practically any job a home owner may have as long as you have an electrical power source. Flexible hosing with quick connecters make this machine a breeze to pull out and have the job going in under 30 seconds as soon as power and water supplies are on. No more having to wonder if my pressure washer is going to crank, no more fighting with awkward stiff hoses and bulky gas powered machines that most always require seasonal maintenance if not used on a very regular basis. I purchased the RE 90 already having confidence in it based on my current inventory of the STHIL product line of chainsaws, weedeaters and blowers.

It has a replaceable water hose connector which may come in handy as (any) unit gets older. It has easily removable connections to allow hose drying before winter storage, it has a neat spinner nozzle that works wonders on sidewalks and siding and an easy controlled fan spray volume/pressure that could allow you to wash the mud off any vehicle. I tried both on my siding and ended up using the fan sprayer nozzle. In terms of power I think it is well placed. This is not my first STIHL product.

All of the trees were just out of reach of being able to use a regular chainsaw and laying against other trees about 14 feet off the ground. I spent about 4 weeks cutting limbs and knocking down the trunks close enough to the ground to be able to finish with a regular saw. To my surprise, I didn\'t even need to get out the regular chainsaw. This thing worked awesome it sliced through everything I threw at it including tree trunks that were up to 18\\" in diameter. I cut what must have been 30 cords of wood and never even dulled up the chain. Mind you I was doing all of this in -10 to -25f temps.\\n\\nAfter that chore was completed, I decided to use my pole saw to cut up an old barn that was half caved in. Again it worked awesome for this purpose as I could stay far enough away from things as they came tumbling down. Not until I found a nail did the chain even become dull. My only complaint is that none of the local dealers stocked a replacement chain for this particular saw.

This thing has so many amazing features, I love it\'s long reach, the bigger bar comes in handy for those big limbs, and it doesn\'t bog down a bit. It cuts like butter! I will say that this machine is quite heavy, and after a few minutes you do need a rest, so for a smaller person this may not be right for you. Overall though, this is an excellent product."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I think this is the right one. I think mine actually extends to 16 feet. So I really don\'t need to get on a ladder. This is worth the extra $100 for the extra 4\' of reach. It\'s a little heavy when reaching tall limbs, but it cuts like a surgical knife, very sharp and I cut all day and the chain never went dull. It starts easy. Be careful about pulling cut branches down though, the two poles can come apart. it\'s a little tricky putting them back together, there are slots on the slides. So tighten it so this doesn\'t happen. Very happy with it. Definitely buy their gas for a longer warranty."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"2019 HT 131 finally got it right. I believe the HT 133 was an attempt of Stihl trying to cut corners and maximize profits. It was a total disaster... HT 131 improved the cheap designs of HT 133 and made an extremely powerful and stable pole saw with a 14 inch 3/8 blade that kicks butt... If you buy Stihl\'s engine oil or gas mixture, you will double the warranty on the pole saw. That increase it to 4 years.

He puts up 8-10 cords of wood a year (has probably put up 100 cords with it at this point) and the thing has been a real workhorse so I decided that I would give Stihl a shot. I could tell right away that these things are engineered with precision because of how smooth running and responsive it is. After a using it a couple times I was hooked. Next I bought an edger, which I have no complaints about. The following year I received the cultivator attachment for fathers day. Wow!

STIHL CLAIMS IT IS NORMAL, BUT IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR THE TWO CYCLE ENGINES AT ALL. THEY WILL RESPOND INSTANTLY AND WIND UP AND STAY AT FULL RPM. THESE 4 STROKER DO NOT AND THEY ARE A HASSLE TO USE WITH PARTIAL THROTTLE COMPARED TO THE 2 CYCLE FS85 I JUST REPLACED THAT RAN PERFECTLY. I WANTED TO TRY A TOOL I CAN CHANGE OUT HEADS/ATTACHMENTS AND NOT KEEP BUYING DEDICATED TOOLS LIKE THE FS85 WAS. I SHOULD HAVE NEVER TRADED MY FS85 PRO AND SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT. NOW I AM STUCK WITH THIS KM111R TO GET MY TRIMMING DONE. IT IS MUCH HEAVIER ALSO. TRYING TO GET THE RPM AT THE SPEED NEEDED TO CUT CORRECTLY FOR ME IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT GETTING INTO 4 STROKER ENGINES FOR TRIMMING, I WOULDN\'T RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL.\\r\\nI STARTED WITH THE KM 130 AND THEN THEY SWITCHED OUT TO NEWER MODELS RIGHT AFTER I BOUGHT IT. NEW MODELS HAVE THE NUMBER 1 FOR LAST DIGIT IN THE MODEL NAME INSTEAD OF 0. THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN MODELS TOO. DON\'T BOTHER WITH THE OLD 110 OR 130, THEY ARE DESIGNED IN 2014 AND OUT DATED COMPARED TO THE 2017 MODEL. SAME GOES FOR THE ATTACHMENTS. BE VERY CAREFUL AND TRY TO BUY THIS YEARS POWER HEAD AND ATTACHMENTS. MY EDGER IS AN OLD MODEL AND THEY BROKE OUT THIS YEARS VERSION AS SOON AS THEY SOLD THE OLD VERSION AND I WASN\'T HAPPY ABOUT THAT EITHER..\\r\\nMY OLD FS85 PRO HAD LIFE TIME WARRANTY ON ELECTRONICS ND SHAFT AND CLUTCH AND NOW THEY ONLY HAVE 2 YEARS! AGAIN, NOT HAPPY AT ALL.\\r\\nTHE KM 130 R WOULD BOG DOWN FROM 8000 RPM AT HALF THROTTLE BECAUSE OF THE LIMITER. THIS MEANS THE THROTTLE WAS TWICE AS SENSITIVE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN, AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS. WE TRIED FOR HOURS TO GET IT TO NOT BE THAT WAY AT THE STIHL DEAR, BUT IT WAS A LOST CAUSE. I SWAPPED IT OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE KM 131 R. I CAN TRY TO KEEP A FINGER UNDER THE THROTTLE TO T MORE UNDER CONTROL RPM WISE. BUT IT STILL TAKE SOO LONG FOR THE ENGINE TO RESPOND TO THE THROTTLE. WE TRIED 5 DIFFERENT VERSIONS AT THE DEALER AND THEY ALL DID IT. EVEN THE NEWER 2017 MODEL OF THE KM 131 R WAS HORRIBLE THIS WAY.. MAYBE IF YOU USED THEM UNDER HEAVY LOAD THE LIMITER WOULDN\'T KICK IN, BUT THEN THE THROTTLE POSITIONING WOULDN\'T BE SO IMPORTANT EITHER. IT\'S A BAD DEAL FOR SURE AND I WOULDN\'T RECOMMEND THEM.\\r\\nTHE GAS TANK IS ABOUT ONE THIRD THE SIZE THEY USED TO BE. THE SHAFT LENGTH IS TOO SHORT FOR ME SO I HAVE TO STOOP TO USE IT ALL OF THE TIME. THIS IS NOT GOOD AT ALL ON THE OL SPINE AND NECK.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHEY DO START WELL AND THE 2017 DOESN\'T HAVE THE ON/OFF SWITCH NOW. IT JUST USES A KILL SWITCH SO IT IS READY TO RESTART W/O NEEDING TO SLIDE THE SWITCH TO ON ANY MORE.

I have a km90, km91 and a km111. Stihl has obviously changed something in the design of these trimmers, the older km90 is great, the 91 and 111 are miserable. They have plenty of power, but they’re very hard to start. They take two to three pulls to fire them up in the morning, but after a couple of uses, they take 10-15 pulls every time and it’s extremely frustrating (oh, and the km111 is only two weeks old and has done this since the beginning).

After two weeks of trying to get this to start easier, I took it back to the dealer (Weingartz - Utica Michigan) to get it serviced.

He had a stroke a couple years ago & it affected his left side & we weren\'t sure he would be able to use it, but he kept insisting he needed it. Well it has been a game changer for him! First off, he can get around with it by just pulling the self propelled bar without the motor running. It will go slowly enough for him. Second, it challenges him to use his left hand & arm in order to start it as he has to push the button with his right hand & raise the bar with his left. Third, it goes slow enough in turtle gear for him to keep up. (Well mostly! Someone stays by his side to make sure he stays steady & it doesn\'t get away from him) Fourth, it has given him the independence and sense of accomplishment he really hasn\'t had in over two years. He was working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day at age 78 when he had his stroke. He\'s never been a slacker that\'s for sure! We contemplated the robotic mower, but are very happy we chose this one for my dad to be able to mow his yard once again. Our 9 year old grandson loves it too. Says it\'s way better than my non self-propelled. He\'s always excited to get to go mow Honey & Grandad\'s yard. My 80 yr old mom loves to use it too. So thank you Stihl for this amazing mower! It spans 3 generations."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I’ve only had to mow twice. The battery hasn’t needed to be recharged yet so I’m impressed with that. Granted, it’s a small city yard. My only complaint is that the bar that engages the blade needs padding. It rests right on my thumb joint. I plan on trying a foam tape to remedy that but the whole thing could be engineered better. \\r\\nOne possible problem I could foresee is the cooling fan under the deck above the blade is made of plastic. Could break if you hit a stick or catch a stone. I’d like to see a stronger material but who knows. It might surprise me. \\r\\nI have a gas powered Stihl chainsaw that has worked great for the 20 years I’ve owned it so I was pretty confident in this product. Pulse electric motors are much more reliable than gas engines. Less things to go wrong. Quieter, better for the environment. No more running to the gas station. Don’t need that gas can anymore. So it’s cheaper to operate over the long run."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"So easy to operate and operates with little noise.

I bought it to replace a 12-year old gas powered push mower, which would get bogged down in thick, moderately long grass no matter how sharp the blade was. Recently a few friends had mentioned to me how good battery powered mowers in general had gotten in the last few years, and that I should get one. I chose Stihl for their reputation and the availably of spare parts should I ever need them. The RMA 510V has far exceeded my expectations. Here are some takeaways from the first month\'s mowing:\\r\\n- Mulches moderate-length, fertilized, spring-time grass with no problem even in \\"eco\\" mode, which lowers the RPMs to save energy. It maintains a constant RPM regardless of variations in grass density. This grass used to bog down my gas mower in certain areas, but not so with the 510V. I\'m confident the 510V will handle anything my old gas mower could and more.\\r\\n- The self propelled wheels work shockingly well. I\'ve owned gas self propelled mower in the past and was expecting the same heavy resistance when attempting to push the mower without engaging the drivetrain. It turns out electric self propelled mowers have the exact same feel as a normal, non-self propelled push mower when the drive is disabled. There are no mechanical linkages to an engine that inhibit traditional self-propelled mowers and add resistance. It\'s just a small electric motor powering the rear wheels, which adds no noticeable resistance when it\'s not engaged. The electric drive is also light and only adds 4 pounds compared to the RMA 510.\\r\\n- I am able to mow my 1/4 acre (with a house on it) with one AP300 battery using eco mode and the self-propelled wheels engaged. I have two batteries, but don\'t need the second one. I rotate them each week and store them at about 20% to ensure long life.\\r\\n- The mower is very light compared to gas mowers.\\r\\n- While performing exceptionally well for mowing, it doesn\'t appear this mower has the same suction as a gas mower if you are looking to suck up and mulch leaves in the fall. I blow mine so this is not an issue.\\r\\n- Other than sharpening the blade on occasion, there is no maintenance with this mower. I find this a huge benefit over gas models.\\r\\n- I have purchased a number of other Stihl AP-Series battery products. Once I put down the initial investment for my two batteries (AP300) and charger (AL500), all the other tools seem inexpensive since for the quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I highly recommend this mower combined with two AP300 batteries and AL500 charger. You will never have any downtime regardless of how large your yard is. The AL500 will fully charge a battery before the 510V will consume one."},{"tags":["Reliable"],"reviewText":"bought last year wasn\'t sure about it, but am really happy now because it is very well built and has the power for even the longest lawns."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I originally purchased the 510 and ended up with the 510V .

This creates a problem when you need to pull the mower backwards because you have a tendency to pull the control bar back which propels the mower forward. The two control bars should be reversed.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can tell the mower is made of a lot of plastic.

I do any heavier trimming with a hand saw to be nice to the plants. I went for the 24\\", rather than the 18\\", and is not underpowered with this smaller motor than the 56 and 87 series which seemed heavy to me. I don\'t think the 30\\" would make me cut any straighter. I\'ve rented the longer bar, bigger model (I think it was an 80\' series) with a much longer bar and had a hard time handling it and couldn\'t go over my head for long, and felt unsafe doing so. I had to rent a pole trimmer to finish the job.

I am one that would rather pay 5% more and avoid headaches and nonsense that comes with low quality tooling. Fill disclosure I am also a weekend woodworker/remodeler so I buy lots of tools. There is a bricks and mortar store (McClendon\'s Hardware in Washington State) that sold this from a person that knows yard tools who did a full setup, started it to make sure it ran, did safety training, and did online registration in the store.

After about an hour of use, the trimmers quit running and the dealer replaced the carburetor. Another hour later, they won\'t run again. I have had nothing but trouble with the Home scape series line. My guess is that Stihl cuts corners and decided to use a cheap Chinese carburetor, if not more than that in these engines. These trimmers, along with my FS55r trimmers maybe had 4 hours combined run time before they just quit. Repair attempts at an authorized dealer were a waste.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy commercial line products from Stihl have been great, but with the home scapper series, you are buying Chinese junk at a premium price.

I haven\'t had this more than two days, so my dependability rating is purely a guess, based on my other, older Stihl equipment (FS 85 trimmer and 036 Pro chainsaw).\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t make money at this job, but I do have to cut about 200\' total of hedges with parts over 6’ tall, twice a week in the springtime, then tapering to every 2 weeks as the summer heat picks up and the growth slows. After 18 years learning the Zen of keeping these straight and sharp, I\'ll call myself an expert. I bought this HS 82 T to supplement my FS 85 which has an adjustable angle trimmer on the end of a 5’ rod. That FS 85 has been great for the last 15 years, but I\'ve grown tired of swinging the relatively short trimmer on the end of the long and heavy stick. I would\'ve tried the 40\\" 87 T if it came in double-sided, but my hedge type only does well when I swing the cut in both directions to keep the branches only pointing outward not vertical, and I didn\'t want to walk twice up and down their lengths. This also looked better than the 87 T to flip upside down and use above my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my job, this trimmer is fantastic. It has a lightweight aluminum stiffener along the length of the bar that\'s not too tall to get in the way. Mine didn\'t come with the nifty semi-circle protector at the tip as in the picture, but my FS 85 didn\'t have one either, and I haven\'t had a problem from the occasional ding onto the sidewalk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhaust being ported toward away from me and toward the cutter is more than welcome. It’s a much quieter running machine than the FS85, with none of its “ding ding ding” of the centrifugal clutch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weight on this felt much lighter than the similar trimmer from another brand that I tried. They’re nearly the same dry weight on paper, but for me it\'s not about total weight, it\'s about the balance. I need to swing the trimmer a zillion times, and for that this trimmer is a dream, beating the other hands down. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that surprised me is that I also really like the rotating trigger handle. At first I thought it too gimmicky, but it really is easier to use the trimmer when the handle is oriented right. I especially like putting it sideways, then the trimmer feels more like it’s in chainsaw mode. Very comfy. I hope I don’t wear out the mechanism, as the plastic-on-plastic swivel handle is the one thing I’m a little worried about for long-term durability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vibration isolation works very well. I didn’t come in after work with my fingers still vibrating from gripping the trimmer for hours, as always happens with using my FS 85. I’d even tried special gloves to reduce the nerve damage, but their thick foam made the work harder. With the HS 82 I got no such problem, and was only wearing regular leather work gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the weighted fuel filter, the trimmer works great in any orientation -- sideways, pointed up or down, and upside down while over my head. I had no fuel feed problems, and speaking of fuel, it seems to be fairly fuel efficient too, which is nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, the specs of this trimmer met the specs for my task, and the rest of the features have made me very happy to use this fantastic tool."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"These are awesome trimmers but a bit heavy for me."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"bought new, put 2 carburators on, it only runs for an hour then won\'t start, finaly trashed it as I didnt have anyone I didn\'t like to give it to!"}],"proTags":[{"count":25,"text":"Easy to Use"},{"count":11,"text":"Light"},{"count":24,"text":"Reliable"},{"count":21,"text":"Easy to Maintain"},{"count":1,"text":"start"},{"count":1,"text":"plenty of power"},{"count":1,"text":"great features"},{"count":1,"text":"cuts up to 3/4 \' stems"},{"count":1,"text":"easy to start"},{"count":1,"text":"not just light but well balanced."}],"conTags":[{"count":7,"text":"Heavy"},{"count":1,"text":"took me so long to get it"},{"count":1,"text":"helps to build muscle"},{"count":1,"text":"i just wish for 6\\" longer cutter bar"},{"count":1,"text":"Unreliable"}],"rating":4.8,"starCounts":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":28},"secondaryRatings":{"Dependability":4.8,"Power":4.9,"Quality":4.7,"Value":4.7},"totNegFeedback":50,"totPosFeedback":205},"reviewCount":30,"reviewStarRating":4.8333,"shortDescription":"This gasoline-powered hedge trimmer provides greater fuel efficiency and less weight when compared to the previous models, while delivering precise trimming performance.","sku":"hs82t","specifications":[{"name":"Displacement","value":"22.7 cc (1.4 cu. in.)"},{"name":"Engine Power","value":"0.7 kW (0.94 bhp)"},{"name":"Blade Length","value":"24\\" or 30\\" (61.0 or 76.2 cm)"},{"name":"Fuel Capacity","value":"460 cc (15.6 oz.)"},{"name":"Strokes Per Minute","value":"5,100"},{"name":"Power Source","value":"Gas"},{"name":"Weight","value":"5.1 kg (11.2 lbs.)"}],"urlImage":["http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-450-225.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-250-200.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-250-125.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-1000-800.jpg"]},{"accessories":[{"sku":"ak10","name":"AK 10 Lithium-Ion Battery"},{"sku":"al101","name":"AL 101 Battery Charger"},{"sku":"alcharge","name":"AL 300 Rapid Battery Charger"},{"sku":"camogls","name":"Camo Glasses"},{"sku":"nrr27","name":"Reusable Ear Plugs"},{"sku":"workvaluegloves","name":"Value Work Gloves"}],"category":"Battery Hedge Trimmers","features":[{"name":"Reduced-Emission Engine Technology -

Probably the gas went bad [again]. I get tired of adding new gas with oil and using only a portion to trim, and then storing the gas only to see it go bad months later [again]. And I do not want another corded electric tool. So I investigated the battery trimmers. On special sale, I purchased the FSA56 string trimmer and the HSA56 hedge trimmer and therefore got two batteries and chargers. I didn\'t think the hedge trimmer would hold up to the gas powered trimmer but it does. It is easier to use, lighter, and cuts just as well if not better.

I went to the Stihl dealership because my research indicated battery-operated hedge trimmers have come a long way as far as operational charge and how long the charge lasts, with Stihl being rated very highly. I\'m glad I did. My HSA-56 lasts 40 minutes which is plenty of time for both my front and back yard hedges. It cuts them like butter, so its got the power I need without the hassle of the power cord dragging around. The bottom of the trimmer is flat and so the hedges do not get caught on it. This trimmer is about medium weight with the battery inside, so cutting will wear on your forearms a bit after a while. Lastly, the battery meter is right in front and shows you how much charge is left. For example, if the indicator appears half way diminished on the meter than you have approximately 20 minutes left.

I certainly didn\'t get 9 football fields of cutting out of it. It was great for trimming small stuff like dead stems of sedum, small clumps of ornamental grass, and yard shrubs. However, when I took it to cut serious ornamental grasses our Garden Club has planted at one of our beautification sites, it just didn\'t have the umph to do the job. The battery died so much sooner than I expected, and the cutting power was so-so. Luckily, I had also taken along the Stihl gas trimmer, on my husband\'s advice, and it was good that I did. The battery powered trimmer is good for light to medium yard work, but it\'s not the \'serious\' trimmer I expected to get to do serious jobs. It\'s lightweight, it starts readily, but it IS a true light weight tool for light weight jobs."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Last summer I bought the HSA 56 and used it several times over that summer. I was impressed with the power, runtime, and ease of use. I oiled the blades, removed the battery and hung it up in the garage until this summer. When I went to use it this summer the blades would not move, there was just a “click”. The great thing about Stihl products is the dealer network. I took it to where it was purchased and had it repaired free of charge. The good thing is Stihl backs its products, the bad thing it failed in less than one year. I recommend this product with reservations."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"After reading all the glowing reviews I purchased this trimmer. In my experience the battery lasted 50% of advertised. After trimming 1 and 1/4 battery charge the trimmer locked up. I took it back to the Stihl dealer and there was no easy fix, i.e. blade jammed. Stihl wants it repaired and will send the parts to the dealer, sometime. As of this writing it has been 8 days since they were ordered but still nothing. I guess it is not uncommon for it to take quite some time for Stihl to honor their warranty. I heartily regret purchasing the battery operated unit. Any twig larger than my little finger gets gnawed on, not cut. My other Stihl products are great, but they have a gasoline engine. The battery operated hedge trimmer, not so much."},{"tags":["Heavy","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Jams ALL the time on tiny twigs!   Does not produce fast blade movement and jams very easy.  Only good for soft plants like ivy or soft stem plants.  Woody Plants like boxwood, sages, and privet are a no go for this trimmer.  I use rhe STIHL electric trimmer for these woody plants.  Also, battery does not last long at all when the whole blade is engaged in cutting.   For the price I would keep looking for a better battery trimmer."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"My first product \\"locked up\\" after the first or second use. I had hoped it would do better if I was very diligent to use the resin cleaner and it finally started. Next time i tried to use it it would not start.

I have a business with a large amount of landscaping but I do not do professional landscaping. My usage is more than a homeowner but less than a professional... I am not happy with this hedge trimmer. Mine is several years old but I only use it maybe 6-10 times each year. At this point I have likely invested more than the cost of another machine just in parts and labor. The drive gear has a raised cam that drives the blades. This has worn down a couple times and had to be replaced. When it begins to wear it gets wedged under the blade causing the machine to seize. 15 minutes removing the gear cover gets you back in business. This eventually wears the oval opening in the blade. The blades and the gear are VERY expensive. The local shop was pretty convinced that the clearances between the cam and the blade were to large and maybe my machine had the wrong part in it. Stihl assured them everything is correct. I don\'t understand why those 2 parts are not hardened enough so they wont break down like that? I love my local dealer and almost always buy from local shops, but why can\'t I look up a part diagram online and have a part at my door the next day? Instead I need to find time to drive into town, stand in line, look up a part and order it and then 3 days later another trip into town to get it. Uhggghh... Now the muffler has fallen off (probably due to the excessive vibration when those parts wear). I haven\'t inspected it yet, but my helper tells me the fasteners didn\'t just fall out, they are stripped and it can\'t easily be fixed. Very rare for me to write a negative review, but I have more than spent enough time/money trying to correct the issue and not being able to finish my work yesterday pushed me to this point. I do not recommend this machine unless design changes have been made in the past 2-3 years since I got mine. Also Stihl\'s online map for local dealers is not working.

These are great quality compared to others but I expect more from Stihl. They should be using a better quality deformed thread locknut and also using locktite too at assembly. then they would probably hold together and I would rate them higher then. I replaced them with pp60 and I would very highly recommend anyone who can afford the extra cost to buy pp60 pp70 or pp80 instead.

That FS 85 has been great for the last 15 years, but I\'ve grown tired of swinging the relatively short trimmer on the end of the long and heavy stick. I would\'ve tried the 40\\" 87 T if it came in double-sided, but my hedge type only does well when I swing the cut in both directions to keep the branches only pointing outward not vertical, and I didn\'t want to walk twice up and down their lengths. This also looked better than the 87 T to flip upside down and use above my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my job, this trimmer is fantastic. It has a lightweight aluminum stiffener along the length of the bar that\'s not too tall to get in the way. Mine didn\'t come with the nifty semi-circle protector at the tip as in the picture, but my FS 85 didn\'t have one either, and I haven\'t had a problem from the occasional ding onto the sidewalk. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhaust being ported toward away from me and toward the cutter is more than welcome. It’s a much quieter running machine than the FS85, with none of its “ding ding ding” of the centrifugal clutch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weight on this felt much lighter than the similar trimmer from another brand that I tried. They’re nearly the same dry weight on paper, but for me it\'s not about total weight, it\'s about the balance. I need to swing the trimmer a zillion times, and for that this trimmer is a dream, beating the other hands down. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing that surprised me is that I also really like the rotating trigger handle. At first I thought it too gimmicky, but it really is easier to use the trimmer when the handle is oriented right. I especially like putting it sideways, then the trimmer feels more like it’s in chainsaw mode. Very comfy. I hope I don’t wear out the mechanism, as the plastic-on-plastic swivel handle is the one thing I’m a little worried about for long-term durability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vibration isolation works very well. I didn’t come in after work with my fingers still vibrating from gripping the trimmer for hours, as always happens with using my FS 85. I’d even tried special gloves to reduce the nerve damage, but their thick foam made the work harder. With the HS 82 I got no such problem, and was only wearing regular leather work gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the weighted fuel filter, the trimmer works great in any orientation -- sideways, pointed up or down, and upside down while over my head. I had no fuel feed problems, and speaking of fuel, it seems to be fairly fuel efficient too, which is nice.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, the specs of this trimmer met the specs for my task, and the rest of the features have made me very happy to use this fantastic tool."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"These are awesome trimmers but a bit heavy for me."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"bought new, put 2 carburators on, it only runs for an hour then won\'t start, finaly trashed it as I didnt have anyone I didn\'t like to give it to!"}],"proTags":[{"count":25,"text":"Easy to Use"},{"count":11,"text":"Light"},{"count":24,"text":"Reliable"},{"count":21,"text":"Easy to Maintain"},{"count":1,"text":"start"},{"count":1,"text":"plenty of power"},{"count":1,"text":"great features"},{"count":1,"text":"cuts up to 3/4 \' stems"},{"count":1,"text":"easy to start"},{"count":1,"text":"not just light but well balanced."}],"conTags":[{"count":7,"text":"Heavy"},{"count":1,"text":"took me so long to get it"},{"count":1,"text":"helps to build muscle"},{"count":1,"text":"i just wish for 6\\" longer cutter bar"},{"count":1,"text":"Unreliable"}],"rating":4.8,"starCounts":{"1":1,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":28},"secondaryRatings":{"Dependability":4.8,"Power":4.9,"Quality":4.7,"Value":4.7},"totNegFeedback":50,"totPosFeedback":205},"reviewCount":30,"reviewStarRating":4.8333,"shortDescription":"This gasoline-powered hedge trimmer provides greater fuel efficiency and less weight when compared to the previous models, while delivering precise trimming performance.","sku":"hs82t","specifications":[{"name":"Displacement","value":"22.7 cc (1.4 cu. in.)"},{"name":"Engine Power","value":"0.7 kW (0.94 bhp)"},{"name":"Blade Length","value":"24\\" or 30\\" (61.0 or 76.2 cm)"},{"name":"Fuel Capacity","value":"460 cc (15.6 oz.)"},{"name":"Strokes Per Minute","value":"5,100"},{"name":"Power Source","value":"Gas"},{"name":"Weight","value":"5.1 kg (11.2 lbs.)"}],"urlImage":["http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-450-225.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-250-200.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-250-125.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/hs82t/1545332a47c6cb6849a9096d771946d2970a05983b9e49f77c9adc2821fff500/hs82t-1000-800.jpg"]},{"accessories":[{"sku":"ak10","name":"AK 10 Lithium-Ion Battery"},{"sku":"al101","name":"AL 101 Battery Charger"},{"sku":"alcharge","name":"AL 300 Rapid Battery Charger"},{"sku":"camogls","name":"Camo Glasses"},{"sku":"nrr27","name":"Reusable Ear Plugs"},{"sku":"workvaluegloves","name":"Value Work Gloves"}],"category":"Battery Hedge Trimmers","features":[{"name":"Reduced-Emission Engine Technology -

Probably the gas went bad [again]. I get tired of adding new gas with oil and using only a portion to trim, and then storing the gas only to see it go bad months later [again]. And I do not want another corded electric tool. So I investigated the battery trimmers. On special sale, I purchased the FSA56 string trimmer and the HSA56 hedge trimmer and therefore got two batteries and chargers. I didn\'t think the hedge trimmer would hold up to the gas powered trimmer but it does. It is easier to use, lighter, and cuts just as well if not better.

I went to the Stihl dealership because my research indicated battery-operated hedge trimmers have come a long way as far as operational charge and how long the charge lasts, with Stihl being rated very highly. I\'m glad I did. My HSA-56 lasts 40 minutes which is plenty of time for both my front and back yard hedges. It cuts them like butter, so its got the power I need without the hassle of the power cord dragging around. The bottom of the trimmer is flat and so the hedges do not get caught on it. This trimmer is about medium weight with the battery inside, so cutting will wear on your forearms a bit after a while. Lastly, the battery meter is right in front and shows you how much charge is left. For example, if the indicator appears half way diminished on the meter than you have approximately 20 minutes left.

I took that to mean \\"over winter\\" type storage. Since then I have seen other places on the internet that the blade should be cleaned after each use. The Stihl brand resin cleaner is really expensive though. Like I said in the last review it is a good little trimmer just know that you may have to use this cleaner every time you use it. Maybe it would be a good idea for the Stihl web site to list this resin cleaner spray as an accessory for this item."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"Only wished it would stay charged longer, but works great"},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"Easy to use and powerful enough for my needs and yard"},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"run great start great WORK HARD LAST LONG TIME THINKS"},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I like this trimmer as well as all of my Stihl tools once it operates.

I was excited to get it, having been impressed with Stihl ads I\'ve seen in Time magazine and on tv. However, it doesn\'t live up to the hype about the battery length of use. I certainly didn\'t get 9 football fields of cutting out of it. It was great for trimming small stuff like dead stems of sedum, small clumps of ornamental grass, and yard shrubs. However, when I took it to cut serious ornamental grasses our Garden Club has planted at one of our beautification sites, it just didn\'t have the umph to do the job. The battery died so much sooner than I expected, and the cutting power was so-so. Luckily, I had also taken along the Stihl gas trimmer, on my husband\'s advice, and it was good that I did. The battery powered trimmer is good for light to medium yard work, but it\'s not the \'serious\' trimmer I expected to get to do serious jobs. It\'s lightweight, it starts readily, but it IS a true light weight tool for light weight jobs."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Last summer I bought the HSA 56 and used it several times over that summer.

In my experience the battery lasted 50% of advertised. After trimming 1 and 1/4 battery charge the trimmer locked up. I took it back to the Stihl dealer and there was no easy fix, i.e. blade jammed. Stihl wants it repaired and will send the parts to the dealer, sometime. As of this writing it has been 8 days since they were ordered but still nothing. I guess it is not uncommon for it to take quite some time for Stihl to honor their warranty. I heartily regret purchasing the battery operated unit.

The acre that surrounds the house is bordered with several types of vegetation to keep the yard private. I\'ve got evergreens that have grown into a wall, a large patch of bamboo and along one edge that borders a swamp, a mix of vegetation that includes some kind of vine that has pretty much interwoven all the shrub trees and created a green wall. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, I\'ve used the large scissor style hedge trimmers, lopers, and the string trimmer to keep the borders looking well. This past winter, we had a very heavy wet storm that took down a lot of trees and really made a mess of the yard border. Lots of bamboo down, a couple evergreens broken, and the vine invaded shrubs were a tangled mess. After two weekends of hacking away at the problem with virtually no progress due to all the various types of flora, I knew I needed something else.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vines and bamboo would wrap around the string trimmer and leave me with a mess to cut and clean. Virtually useless. The chainsaw would not cut any of the small stuff. And switching from shears to the lopper on every other cut was taking forever. I have an old electric hedge trimmer which I use to keep the bushes in front of the house properly shaped, but it didn\'t work well at all on the border items. Part of that might be the long extension cord runs, but mostly just because of the sheer volume of vegetation that needed to be hacked away.. \\r\\n\\r\\nI took some photos of the various types of flora I needed to remove and then visited my local hardware store which is a Sthil dealer. He looked at the pictures, asked about the electric hedge trimmer and then laughed. In his opinion, I needed a \\"real\\" hedge trimmer. He brought me to the selection and started talking about a mid-level machine and how the power and reach of the device would make quick work of all but the thickest of branches. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe discussed the pros and cons about the smaller machine or the larger one. Finally, I asked about the model in question here with the extended reach. Well, it was more powerful than any of the \'regular\' trimmers we were looking at. It was heavier. But I felt I had a better reach too. I had the electric one for the fine pruning of the front bushes, so I didn\'t see a need for a \'delicate\' touch. I needed brute force and the ability to go from the ground to the top of the \'walls\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next step was to look at the modular system. I could get a longer reach, and could even add extensions. But the tool was MUCH heavier, didn\'t balance as easily, and use of the sling would be almost mandatory. - a pain when you need to stop to clear what you just cut. And, nearly double the price once you added together the powerhead and the large trimmer bar. The Mistress of Finance has to be kept happy, so despite visions of swapping implements, I controlled my inner tool wielding ape. Given all these factors, I decided that the HL 56 K was most likely the tool I needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, how did it work?\\r\\n\\r\\nWONDERFUL!\\r\\n\\r\\nI started in on a mix of brambles, scrub sumac, and \\"the vine\\" and with the exception of a few branches that needed the lopers, I was pretty much able to just carve the mess like a Thanksgiving Turkey. After the first pass, I clipped off the thicker branches and raked the mess out. While the kids carted the clippings off to the mulch area with the tractor, I went back in and used the trimmer to clean up the \'wall\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next area was a larger sumac tree which had broken and fallen into the yard. It was a mass of vines and other scrub. I could not even get to the trunk to cut it free. Oh, and did I mention the thistle? Yea, 1\\" long razor sharp thorns. Not climbing in there either. Once again, I simply carved out large sections of the flora, carefully loaded it into the cart with gloves, and opened up the larger tree, to which the chainsaw made quick work.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnto the bamboo. The snow did a number on this. Thick mats bent well into the yard. I\'d started to hack away at this before with a string trimmer and shears. And frankly, it looked terrible. The HL 56 K was the tool for the job. I was not shocked when it took time to carve out a ground to top cut. The bamboo is thick and tough. But I was very surprised how the machine never felt as if it was struggling. Steady pressure and the thick mat seemed to just fall away. Slice after slice came down easily. The result was a very nice stand of bamboo. The cut pieces pulled back into the mass and the new straight growth became the facing \'wall\' Almost a layered look with the older growth behind standing tall over the younger frontage. I had to clean up a lot down at the base where the remains of broken stalks lay on the ground, but the trimmer worked there as well once I \'fluffed\' the stalks off the ground with a rake. Even the places I\'d already spent hours hacking at came out great and in only a fraction of the time. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnto the wall of evergreens. I\'d already pulled out the tree that had broken. But the remaining boughs were not at all smooth. The string trimmer can only really keep new growth in check. It can\'t cut back older growth that is moving outward. While I took a shower in the short needles which ended up in all my clothing, I simply swung the trimmer from ground to as high as I could reach and made a nice clean wall. I did have to go back with the lopers and a step-ladder to cut back larger branches which poked out here and there, but it was far easier a job than I\'d had before and the results were a very uniform frontage. No irregularity due to stuff the string trimmer could not cut.\\r\\n\\r\\nI finished up the yard border by trimming the entrances to the various trails that run from the yard to the back meadow area. And I was even able to trim back several overhanging trees so that the smaller branches were not hanging into the trail. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, the border to the yard was the cleanest it has ever been, the \'walls\' are straight and they reach up as high as the wall is tall. Even the tallest evergreens were trimmed up as high as I needed. I\'ve not been able to do that since I stopped trying to use the string trimmer on a step-ladder. A bit higher and I\'d have had an issue, but the trimmer was easily held vertically overhead with just one hand to clip those highest of branches. For me, that was a reach of about 12-13 feet high. Yes, if I had to trim that high a lot, I\'d need a different method, but for the few places I needed to go that high, it worked fine. I really liked the fact that I never had to stoop. To reach the ground level was just a matter of pointing the tool down and being careful not to touch the cutter directly on the ground. In almost every situation, I could very easily hold and use without needing any odd body position. At the worst, I had to twist my hand a bit to operate the throttle. \\r\\n\\r\\nI did like the fact that the machine ran in any orientation, never leaked a drop of fuel, and no matter where I touched it was never concerned with touching hot engine parts. These kind of things should be a no-brainer these days, but far too many power tools skimp on the little things. Glad to see Stihl is still not doing that. As I read in another review, the quality does not seem to have suffered as time has gone on. I also love the fact that I never had to add fuel the whole 4+ hours I was working in the yard. Sure I did not run the tool non-stop, but knowing I can fuel up and have the operating time to go do real work and not worry about dragging along a fuel can is a real plus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe machine is fairly simple to use. I find the indicators on the choke to be a little confusing. I swear, the \\"choke off\\" icon looks more like \\"full choke\\". Still, once I figured that little thing, everything else made sense. I did read the manual later (all 2 pages that were not the legal warnings to explain to boneheads not to do dumb things) Even that wasn\'t real clear on the choke settings. Like my chainsaw, operating the throttle opens the choke automatically, so one less thing to deal with. I don\'t think I\'ll ever need the \'half-choke\' position, because like my chainsaw, it only takes a half-hearted pull to get a warm motor started again. If my past experience is any guide, I doubt I\'ll ever need to pull this more than twice. The throttle is easy to operate and once held, never gets in the way. A couple times I had to reposition my hand to get both the safety and the trigger to depress properly, but it wasn\'t a big deal - the safety isn\'t at all in the way. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the record, I only use pre-mixed Stihl fuel. Yes, there are cheaper brands, but I\'ve never had any fuel issues. Heck, even storing my chainsaw for 18 months with fuel in it has never resulted in any starting issues. I expect the same with this tool. That kind of \\"ready to go\\" reliability is nice. Chances are this tool will see more service than my chainsaw as I trim out that yard perimeter every few weeks. Yes, it is a little more expensive than just filling up at the pump, but I never have to worry about mixing or if the fuel is good. Life is too complicated to deal with bad gas and mixing oil on top of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have not given a dependability mark as I\'ve only used the tool once, but I have other Stihl tools and even other brands which date back to the 1990\'s and still start and run as well today as they did when new. Dependability comes more to good maintenance. However, when you start with a high quality product, keeping them running is not a chore. Stihl has always been well built and at this time I see no reason to doubt that my new trimmer will be any different."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I bought this tool for cutting along 1000 feet of 20 foot hedges that were gradually over the years taking my property over. \\r\\nThat\'s what I bought it for... ! \\r\\nWhat I didn\'t realize is that, the tool is also GREAT for cutting tall weeds, including Johnson Grass ! \\r\\nThe worst enemy to our weed trimmers !\\r\\nAnyone that has put their weed trimmers into tall Johnson Grass KNOWS the outcome is stopping and pulling the grass out of the spinning head that gets clogged with the grass ! \\r\\nSo..

After taking them to up to 4 different Stihl repair shops no one can fix them. I currently bought 4 new ones and two were taken to the Stihl rep which are being sent back to the factory. While these units are operating they are 5 stars but with the issue described I can only rate them at 3 stars.

I have a business with a large amount of landscaping but I do not do professional landscaping. My usage is more than a homeowner but less than a professional... I am not happy with this hedge trimmer. Mine is several years old but I only use it maybe 6-10 times each year. At this point I have likely invested more than the cost of another machine just in parts and labor. The drive gear has a raised cam that drives the blades. This has worn down a couple times and had to be replaced. When it begins to wear it gets wedged under the blade causing the machine to seize. 15 minutes removing the gear cover gets you back in business. This eventually wears the oval opening in the blade. The blades and the gear are VERY expensive. The local shop was pretty convinced that the clearances between the cam and the blade were to large and maybe my machine had the wrong part in it. Stihl assured them everything is correct. I don\'t understand why those 2 parts are not hardened enough so they wont break down like that? I love my local dealer and almost always buy from local shops, but why can\'t I look up a part diagram online and have a part at my door the next day? Instead I need to find time to drive into town, stand in line, look up a part and order it and then 3 days later another trip into town to get it. Uhggghh... Now the muffler has fallen off (probably due to the excessive vibration when those parts wear). I haven\'t inspected it yet, but my helper tells me the fasteners didn\'t just fall out, they are stripped and it can\'t easily be fixed. Very rare for me to write a negative review, but I have more than spent enough time/money trying to correct the issue and not being able to finish my work yesterday pushed me to this point. I do not recommend this machine unless design changes have been made in the past 2-3 years since I got mine. Also Stihl\'s online map for local dealers is not working. I plug in my zip/town and it gives me shops 4 hours away."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"have 3 pair ben in shop 4-6 times.Always having to adjust carburetors."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I use this trimmer heavily during the summer., probably about 15 hours a week.

She has had some medical issues which inhibits her from using hand pruners. She has never owned any power tool before today and she was so excited to try this out. Once we charged the battery I tried it out then turned her loose. She was like a kid in a candy store using it and said it is the best tool she has ever had. The battery held up to a few hours of thinning bushes. It is light enough for extended use with her and had plenty of power to handle what she threw at it. It is going to save me lots of time from having to use had pruners for her and also give her the freedom to maintain her landscaping for many more years. It is a great little tool overall. This was my first experience with a battery operated tool and I was highly impressed especially for it being such a small lightweight unit."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I bought this for my wife who wanted a small saw for pruning bushes bigger than her loppers would cut. It works great for that. I borrowed it to take down a small forest of rhododendron and it was a champ, even cutting through trunks 4-5 inches in diameter. We hauled the branches to the brush pile and unloaded them. As we were leaving, I drove over a limb laying on the ground that popped up and somehow got wedged under my truck, pinned between the body, the driveshaft and the exhaust. No amount of pulling would get it free. Enter the Stihl GTA 26 - I crawled under the truck and had to cut the limb in three places to get it free. I never could have done it with a hand saw or a chain saw. It is absolutely worth the small price!"},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light"],"reviewText":"Wife always wanted her own chainsaw to do small pruning jobs and not have to fight a hand pushed pruning saw. Our son-in-law has a tree trimming company and had one for doing small limb clean-up when he\'s tried into a tree up high. He let her \\"borrow\\" his and almost didn\'t get it back. Now she has her own small tough and effective handheld chainsaw and doesn\'t point ant tell me what needs to be pruned up - she goes at it and I can concentrate on the hardwood firewood cutting. Recommend a second battery so that you can keep cutting! Stihl could have molded or added a loop or eye on the handle for attaching a lanyard, its not that heavy but when up a tree its nice not having to worry about it dropping!

You can’t crowd it, but if you let the saw do the cutting it works good. Battery life is decent for what it’s for. I got about 30-45 minutes out of a charge since a good bit of the time was untangling the branches and figuring out which needed to be removed, not continuous cutting. No, it’s not for cutting continuously or using on big stuff. It’s really handy to get into tight places that would normally be cut with lopers or a hand saw.

My solution was to insert a cardboard ship between the bar and the alignment block to take up the chain slack. This prevented bar movement when the bar.

That\'s why I made the drive to my local Stihl dealership, bypassing several big box stores and the brands they carry. The edger is a piece of quality machinery that I expect will last me a lifetime. I am a homeowner, not a lawn business, so I opted for this model. I am very pleased with it thus far. This goes beyond Stihl, but I don\'t understand why edgers seem to be priced so much more than string trimmers. The entry-level string trimmer by Stihl is at least $100 cheaper. Why is that? I know that you get what you pay for. The price of this model was still comparable to the competitor brands available at the big box stores (think Echo, etc.). That\'s really my only \\"complaint\\", if you will - like I said, it\'s more of a market thing, not directed at Stihl. I\'d recommend this edger!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I bought this edger to replace another one I had very recently bought. The price for the Stihl edger was the same as a competive brand I bought at Home Depot and the quality and power of the Stihl blew the other product out of the water. The competive brand edger wouldn\'t stay solid and had really weak power. Absolutely LOVE this edger and it\'s my favorite yard tool to fire up when doing the yard and that tool alone makes me look forward to doing my lawn. Very comfortable, easy to use, starts everytime, and has power to do anything. It cut through the dirt and everything to make my groove and I wasn\'t even going full throttle, very impressed. I\'ll tell everyone I know to buy Stihl products any day of the week and twice in Sunday!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Lots of power; I was pleasantly surprised at the power. Gets the job done well.

I wanted to replace my old 4 stroke three wheeled blade edger with something lighter and easy to start. It is great having the primer bulb and choke lever to start. I was really surprized how fast it trims. It is about 4 times as fast. I did get a shoulder strap for it and is very comfortable. Stihl is the best."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"This product is absolutely amazing and I use it for over 16 yards that i cut in my neighborhood and have used it for over a year and no problems at all. Also it pulls by the 2nd pull every time!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I bought this to use commercially, since they did not have any other models. Overall, I am very happy! I thought it would not be powerful enough for commercial use, but I was wrong. For commercial users with very light edging needs, this is a great unit if it\'s all that the dealer has. I am not a fan of the handle, since it is not rubberized, but this can be avoided by buying the 91 or 70 (which I would have bought if my dealer had it). I would reccomend this edger for a commercial setting with very light duty maintained edges, if the other edgers are not available."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I’ve slowly been adding Stihl’s to the garage as items have aged / failed. This time the electric edger went up in smoke - literally. Having had enough with long extension cords and the temperamental performance from electrics, it was time to switch to a gas powered. I was looking at the professional line, but picked up the homeowner version (model was not available). As with the other Stihl’s, starts easy and has a good balance. The 56CE had the power to complete the job which burned up the electric. One improvement would be to have an edge guide to run along the concrete."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"For the first time in years, I was able to start my edger with ease, edge my whole yard (1/2 acre) without stopping to fix the head or restring the spool. It was great! I finished my yard in record time without any temptations to throw the edger in the garbage. LOL.... The only draw backs I have found are due to my stature. Being only 5\'5\\" tall with small hands, I\'m finding the length of the shaft to be a tad cumbersome. I feel with time, I\'ll be able to acclimate to this. I am not, however, able to acclimate to the diameter of the cutting head that requires you to press on both sides and pull the cap off at the same time in order to refill the string. My hand is simply too small to span the diameter of the spool head to press both buttons while using the other hand to pull the cap off. I ended up replacing the head with an easier design. So all in all, a great purchase. One that I\'m sure I\'ll be pleased with for years to come."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I was using a 4 stroke three wheel dealio from a big box store to do my edging. It was anemic at best and if it weren\'t for the ability to start it with a drill good luck ever getting it running. It did get the job done though...barely. Enter the Stihl 56 C-E and all problems disappear. This machine starts like a dream, a 10 year can start it easily. It has loads of power too, plenty. The edger is light at the head and very easy to control. I just love this thing!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"This is by far the best edger I\'ve owned; when the previous one died I realized it was time to buy an edger that would last (just like my Stihl chain saws, lawn trimmer and blower). So this edger has been all that I expected with one nuisance - the pull cord for the starter must not be strong/thick enough since it\'s broken really early in this edger\'s life. Compared to the other Stihl products I have; all of which I\'ve used for years and the starter cords on them are all the original...not one has snapped after a LOT of use. But the cord on this edger failed after only 3 summers of periodic use (maybe a full pulls on the cord every 4-6 weeks during the summer months). Rough math - after less than 100 pulls it\'s now broken? Seems unusual. Otherwise completely satisfied with this edger."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I\'ve only used it twice. So, I am not sure how durable it will be. I still have to introduce it to my 2 teenage boys. So far, it starts easy, seems good enough power for residential lawn care...possibly underpowered if you have rocky, hard pan yard.\\r\\nI bought this because the battery operated trimmers were dying before I could finish my trimming. I live on corner lot with lots of sidewalk to edge. I would drain 2 batteries and still not finish edging.\\r\\nOverall, I would recommend based on my limited experience. It made edging so much faster than a line fed trimmer. And gives much better results."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"It took a few times before I was comfortable using it .

The only problem I have with this edger is that it vibrates terribly, you get used to it, but It still affects the user with fatigue.

There is no guide to prevent blade from grinding against the edge of the concrete."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"The engine is outstanding. In fact is sounds like a Stihl! The only complaint I have is that the bump release on the line seems to be selective and by selective, I mean I had to stop and release line manually (3) times the first time I used it. The head of it is very wide and the end can be difficult to release unless you have giant hands. All in all it runs very well. The line release is the only complaint. Plenty of power, cranks every time. For the trustworthiness of the motor, I can release some line every now and again."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Easy start up, decent power, lightweight great for residential use, my only complaint, maybe this was due to improper assembly at the place i got It, right after it starts up, in the second choke position(before you pull the trigger) the blade is going at full speed only way to stop it is to pull the trigger to give it gas and let off, then it will stop, just seems odd that the blade goes full force before you give it any gas, other than that very happy with it, will be getting more 2 cycle products in the future"},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"Starts easy, good power, guard sucks!

Most brands I have used or purchased seemed more sturdy with much less weight.

There doesn’t seem to be a replacement head that would work to my satisfaction. \\r\\nI am a 76 year old man in relative good health and strength and the weight is a big turn off to me.

There are two things I don\'t like about this edger. One, it\'s hard to start, regardless of the choke setting. I pull and pull and pull and pull until it finally starts. Two, this edger is very uncomfortable to use. I\'ve had many different edgers, from 2 cycle to 110 volt wired to 24 volt battery. None of these prior non-Stihl edgers caused me any discomfort.

The automatic line feed never worked properly. I could only go about 10 to 15 feet on any project before I needed to take the cap off and re-string the unit. Taking the lid off the string compartment required the use of a screwdriver to pry it open. Very cumbersome! It was also more awkward and heavier than other brands (heavier dose not mean better!). Usually started after 3 to 4 tries which is better than average for a line trimmer, but did a poor job of cutting any grass. Seemed weaker than others.

Over the last 20 years, I\'ve used string trimmers, string trimmers with rotating heads and edging attachments to a multi use tool. I\'ve used gas, corded electric and cordless electric. Every tool I\'ve ever used was a struggle, with endless back and forth to get a deep, clean edge. So I finally bit the bullet and decided to get a premium dedicated edger. I did all my research and decided on the FC70. When I went to the retailer to purchase it, a man walked past and asked me what I was looking for. He then told me that he works for a landscape company and I should get the FC91 instead since it has more power ( and no, he didn\'t work for the seller). For $50 more I figured what the heck and having the recommendation of a professional who uses them frequently was the final straw. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, I stared down the wooly edges of my yard. The machine fired up and I started to edge. To my surprise and astonishment, for the first time ever, I did not have to move the edger back and forth. Seriously. I walked along at a decent pace, and this machine left a beautiful edge. \\r\\n\\r\\nSave yourself time, hassle and aggravation. Get the FC91 and you\'ll spend more time enjoying your lawn than working a lesser machine back and forth and back and forth."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Reliable"],"reviewText":"Just picked up the FC91 from my local dealer.

I needed something for yard/woods cleanup and to cut firewood. Over the past weekend I used the saw to cut two downed cherry trees (about 14 in in diameter each) and to cut down a sweet gum tree (about 16 inch diameter and 25 feet tall). The saw started up on the fifth pull (even though it was about 34 degrees outside). I had to retension the chain multiple times over the three hours or so of cutting, but as the manual states, it is expected with a new chain. I found the saw to have a good deal of power considering it\'s size, and never had any issues cutting through large pieces as long as I let the saw do the work. The saw is light and well balanced and would highly recommend. Great value for the price.

Plan your cuts and let the saw do the work and you won\'t have any issues.

I use my two 170s to cut up anything under about 12 inches. I like using the small saws to do most of my cutting because they are lighter, use less fuel and if I hit an old nail or barbed wire it\'s not a big deal. Just grab the other saw or grab a file. Less teeth that are quicker to sharpen. If I hit a nail with my big saws I cry a little. They are very reliable and I have had no issues with them other than one leaks a little oil when not in use.

I will continue to buy and recommend Stihl products because, after over 30 years using Stihl, I have become convinced of their reliability and ease of use. I would recommend that if you have a lot of cutting to do on larger logs (over 12\\"), it would probably make sense to purchase a saw with a larger powerhead.

Finally got tired, broke down and bought a chainsaw. Asked around and the stihl brand came up a handful of times so I went for it. I don’t run a tree service or anything but I have a fire place in my apartment and cut some wood for it each year. The day I purchased the saw I cut for about an 1 hour and a half without issue. Followed the instructions of store associate I spoke to when I picked it up to start it, it started right up. Was nervous of the bar oil/saw dust residue I was seeing on the saw at first but proceeded anyway because of confidence in the whole thing up to then, plus stihl gave me an extended warranty for picking up some of their premixed fuel at time of purchase so I was less wary to just run the saw. Cut great. Refueling was easy. Restarted fine. It’s so light my arms didn’t get tired at all. Over all I’m co fused at some of the bad reviews. I’ve never owned and maybe even never started a chainsaw before and this whole experience has me kicking myself why I didn’t Buy one a long time ago. For comparable money to buying your own wood, gaining the ability to cut your own as many times as you want to seems like a no brainer. I cut more wood than I intended to go through so I even gave some of it away with cutting it having been so easy.

Only complaints are i think this saw may be a bit under-powered for the 16\\" bar as its not hard to bog it in dense wood and it consumes bar oil more than some other saws i\'ve used (im OK with this if it keeps the chain and bar in better shape).

This saw has plenty of power, and handled my yard projects with ease. If I was going to use the saw the way my dad and grandpa did, I would choose the appropriate model and not the cheapest option. As far as the people who have had overheating issues, this is a LIGHT DUTY saw! Treat it like a 50 percent duty cycle, an hour on, an hour off. If you want to run it all day long for some reason, get a more professional model that is made for that. For the people who have hard starts, check your fuel! Fuel gets stale quick. When it comes to premix oil, use a premium one like Stihl or any other reputable mix. Cheap mix does show in how it performs. Use ethanol free gas if you are going to store it a while, and dump old gas. If you only use it once a year, clean the carb in the spring to remove any varnish.

This little saw is surprisingly powerful and can handle cutting chores I might have previously reserved a bigger saw for.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have just about worn out the original chain, yet even that keeps cutting despite being seriously worn and sharpened several times.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also like that there are many available parts/aftermarket parts as well. One that I found handy and almost necessary - metal bucking/felling dog. This saw doesn\'t have real ones - instead utilizing small spikes molded into the case. Yes, this works - but having metal teeth like it\'s larger brethren is helpful.

My only reference have been Stihl, E**o, and Hus*****a. All good saws.\\nThis is the first chain saw that I\'ve owned and I am very pleased. I spent the entire day clearing fence line on my family\'s property. Mostly trees 4-8\\" thick with the occasional 10 inch tree. This saw cut through them like a hot knife through butter.\\nI cannot say enough good things about the saw, it did exactly as it was supposed to.\\nI am a Stihl fan for life.

I\'ve used two of these extensively in timberland for brush clearing and tree pruning. The chain must be kept on the tight side to reduce the frequency of it coming off. The first time it comes off, it will wipe out a cover protrusion, which I suppose is to prevent injury. If so, it will function only once for that. The problem with a tight chain is it will wear the bar too quickly and can ruin the tip roller. Also the drive sprocket wears out quickly. It\'s helpful to buy the deeper bar allowing a chain with thicker drivers. This seems to reduce the frequency of the chain coming off.\\nThe saw is light enough that I can use the saw with one hand and reach high branches.

If it has Stihl on it, I’m not afraid to abuse it a little. And this saw doesn’t have to be treated like any other saw you will find for the money. The bar is a little sensitive I have found. It will be the first replacement I will make. The engine is strong and reliable so far (less than a gallon of fuel ran through it). To anyone entering the world of gas powered equipment, buy Stihl, maintain it with their parts and it will last a lifetime.

I bought it to cut up the smaller branches and yard waste that really didn’t need the MS661’s heft. For that mission the Saw is okay. I plan on upgrading the bar and chain to a 16” Rollomatic ES or E Light that will accept a PS or PM chain. This will give the Saw a bit more kerf and hopefully cure the issue I’m having with the chain itself. The PMM chain is great for my pruner but in the saw I’m getting hammered drive links so badly that it throws the chain off and binds in the bar.

My solution is, I keep a can of carb cleaner in my saw tool box a couple quick blasts and were good.

I can carry this saw by foot way out in the field on fence lines and deep into the timber to hang tree stands and not worry about it getting heavy and wearing me out.

I took it to the dealer and after they got the engine torn down I was shown the inside of the cylinder that had been scored by fine sawdust that had made it\'s way past the cheap air filter that looked more like gauze than something that would be used to stop bleeding than filter air. Because my MS311 was way to big to finish what I was cutting I purchased another 170 even though the other was still well within the original warranty. When I bought the new one per the stihl rules it was filled with gas and oil then started before I was able to take it, while running it the guy that started is checked how well it was oiling the chain and it looked minimal at best and said the same to the guy. I was told that it used less oil because of the design of things and there was a glistening of oil on the chain as there should have been. It didnt make a full tank of gas before it began having issues staying running at anything more than an idle. After pulling the sprocket cover off I noticed that it was not oiling the chain at all. When I returned it to the dealer I got the answers of a carb issue for it not running right and something clogging the oil line that kept it from properly oiling the chain.

I ran the saw about 7 times with no problem, other than having to sharpen the chain frequently and constantly having to adjust the tension. Then it happened, it threw the chain. Ok, no big deal, I remove cover, re-install the chain, we’re back in business. It happened again within 5 mins. So I took it to my local authorized Stihl repair station. Tech looks it over, and says I need a new chain. He installed it and I’m out the door. I ran it through one tank of fuel, and then it threw the chain again.

Tried to pull the sparkplug wire from the sparkplug and ripped the protective boot right off. Found somthing I have never seen in years of working on engines. Stihl got so cheap they coil a stiff wire like a spring around the spark plug then basically stab it into the coil wire. So from I see from the vibration of running it can cause it to loosen a create bad connection. I was sick of dealing with a cheap Poulan so I figured by a Stihl so when I need it (2-3 times a year on average) I would be good to go. What a giant disappointment.

I\'m concerned with the quality of the bar on the 170 but I\'m stuck with it after the purchase. I\'ll just have to remember to not come close to the initial cut with the front of the bar but my take on this is that it should not have happened.

The saw was started 3 times and was always under use on a tree or limb during use. With half the orginal tank of fuel left, the saw would no longer start. Took into in to a certified Stihl Dealer. Here are some of the responses I have received.\\n1.) Saw had to been run too lean, we will not stand by our saw\\n2.) You can just get a new saw from us for another $150\\n3.) Warranty is not an insurance policy.\\n4.)

Once he was satisfied he proceeded to pull the rope to no avail. He then removed the cover and pulled the spark plug. Said it’s getting gas. Out the plug back in a proceeded to pull the rope again. Gave up and wrote me a repair ticket. I will give them one shot at repairs before requesting a refund."},{"tags":["Unreliable","Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"Bought this a month ago need to take back the oiling part sucks"},{"tags":["Unreliable","Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"I purchased this saw nine months ago, I hate it, I got it for small brush and wood, even for that it’s underpowered boggy saw, should put homelites name on it doesn’t deserve stihl name, half the time doesn’t start have to fix spark plug wire"},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Cut up 1 - 12\\" maple tree.

Never had a problem until the fuel tank cracked. Went to ##### ##### in ######### and purchsed this saw. I waited a month to use th saw due to weather conditions and schedule... i was clearing a fence line and was cutting 1-2” thick tallow trees from the line. The machine would not stay running and the bar was so flexible, the chain continually jumped the bar and when it did it the first time, it made chinks in the guide tabs of the chain and had to file them down to get the chain to run free in the rail. I cut maybe 10 trees that were no more than 2” in diameter and brought the machine back to ##### ##### where I was told too bad so sad. They gave me the local Reps Number for Stihl. Left four messages, then gave up. I wanted to give my business to an American company, but it will not be Stihl. I have a Brand New (minus 10 Cuts) 171 for sale...cheap needs chain and bar!

The first time I used it, it worked very well and cut smoothly. After that, it has been nothing but problems. For one thing, when trying to find parts associated with it such as a replacement chain or a file, there are numerous complications. The parts manual does tell you which parts you should get depending on your model, but regardless of which Stihl dealer you go to, the file cannot be found; it isn\'t carried. And the chains are described in a confusing way that can easily lead one to buy one that seems like the right size but isn\'t.\\r\\nAs for the product itself, the chain becomes severely dull far too easily. I would understand a dull chain after a few uses, but a new chain, or one professionally sharpened by a dealer, becomes dull before the tank runs out of fuel. The owner\'s manual does not give clear advice as to how the chain should be sharpened. The engine isn\'t entirely reliable either. I have operated numerous gas powered items and not had a problem, but this one floods easily and needs to be babied and tugged many times in order to start.\\r\\nFor those wondering, I have ensured that the fuel was mixed properly with oil, that the lube compartment has never run dry, and that the chain has been properly tensioned. And it was bought brand new from a dealer, not used."},{"tags":["Unreliable","Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"Huge Stihl fan. I own / have owned several other Stihl products ( Chain Saws, Weed Whackers, Leaf Blowers) and I love them all. That said my experience with this saw is that it is not worth buying.

This saw was very frustrating and caused problems between me and my dealer. This is a decent local dealer that that had always treated my family right where we had done a lot of business and purchased several Stihl saws. The dealer voluntarily gave my money back which was above and beyond what he they had to do but now our relationship is strained so I have to settle for a lesser dealer or buy a different brand saw.

For the task at hand, limbs and small trees, this saw plows through it all. He has the paint worn off of the bar from all the use. The saw has served him well through 2 hurricanes and a handful of nasty thunderstorms. As well as the normal trimming work he does on his property throughout the year.

I use my Farmboss for larger trees. the 180 worked great and is much lighter than carrying my farm boss. I have two Stihl chainsaws, a Stihl weedeater, and a Stihl blower. I got tired of buying and then returning new products at other retailers. I haven\'t had any issues yet with any of these. The 180 starts on 2nd or 3rd pull. No complaints with easy adjust for chain.

I am glad I went with this saw. It is easy to start, cuts smoothly, and the weight is great for many hours of work by a weekend warrior. I was able to take down a 50\' tree with a 2.5\' diameter trunk with this saw. Really is a great cutting machine and the easy chain tension adjustment means no tools needed. Also, Stihl does a great job with the basics. The gas tank runs dry before the chain oil reservoir, so as long as you fill oil every time you gas up, you don\'t have to worry about a dry chain. Last thing, the saw chain is not too aggressive so you don\'t get too much kick back.

Called the customer service # and was told to take it back to the big box store where I bought it. Stupid Me!! Went back to Stihl as I should have done first. The Ms 180CBE is a GREAT saw!! Much lighter than the Farm Boss and does everything I need it to do at my deer lease and around my property...limbing,trimming.cutting of mesquite and other trees and brush. MUCH lighter and easier to maneuver. The Easy Start feature is OUTSTANDING. Always starts fast and has plenty of power for cutting.

I use a 16\\" guide bar, and find this to be an excellent setup working on the mostly smaller trees I am cleaning up. The light weight of the saw and minimal vibration make it comfortable and safe to handle on long days; I much prefer this saw for the type of cutting I\'m doing (4\\"-12\\" trunk diameters, cutting trunks into 6\' sections, removing all limbs, cutting dozens of trees per day) as compared to my older larger Stihl and Husky saws. For larger trees a more powerful saw will work faster and I do bring out the bigger saws on occasion, but for the mostly small size trees that I\'ve been cutting this saw has been just perfect. Very fuel efficient too. I find the tool-free chain adjuster to be a really nice feature.

Good saws, I was cutting 6-8 cords of wood per year for heating in Michigan and Alaska. I now live in Georgia and don\'t heat with wood but I still cut a tree a year for firewood. I\'m 62 and my 30 yr old chainsaws and I just don\'t have the energy we use too. I was looking for a replacement for those heavy cantankerous saws. I went on the internet for reviews and Stihl seemed to have the least bad reviews. This past weekend I cut down a 70yr old 24 inch oak tree with my MS180 with 16in bar. It did the job. The easy start system was great. An 18in bar or longer would have been a little easier felling the tree but would have been awkward cutting up the limbs. I was impressed with this little saw. I hope that it will last me 30yr like my yellow saw. The MS180 used very little gas. It was very easy to handle. It was a little cantankerous starting when hot but I\'ll figure out it\'s trick to start it before too long. Very easy to pull with the Easy Start system, it really saves my arm..

Take the cover off the saw, push the switch to the off position, you should see a spring want to make contact with a brass pin that grounds out the spark ( like the old lawn mowers used to shut off) This brass pin slid out of its required location (small groove that allows pin to snap into the plastic) to make contact with the spring. Take a needle nose and slide it back to where it makes contact. Keeping in mind that this brass pin should have a black wire attached to it that runs back to the ignition - so when they make contact it kills the spark.\\n\\nThis is a great saw for what it is, keep it clean, keep the chain sharp and it should last many many years."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Nice starting strong running saw.

I grew up on a farm and have used both bigger and smaller chainsaws. I live in town now with rows of trees in the back. I also help a friend with her large tree filled yard in the country.\\n\\nI didn\'t buy this saw to drop trees, only to clean them up and clean up occasional wind damage. I read some forums and was put off by the wannabe History channel loggers advising people to buy giant saws just to brag I guess.\\nThis saw so far does what I want it to. If I needed a bigger one I\'d have bought one or I\'ll go nuts and borrow my friends 880. So be honest about your needs. If you need a saw for clean up work and dropping a small tree or two on occasion this one does the job. If you need a saw to drop several trees and run for hours at a time you should move to a larger more rugged model number.\\n\\nThe saw starts easy. I\'ve seen reviews saying it doesn\'t. I wonder though if people are understanding how these later model saws, trimmers, blowers etc. start? If you are new to the technique read the manual or even better yet scan the barcodes on the manual cover to watch videos. A big thumbs up to Stihl for being tech friendly in that regard. I had to wonder what my farmer grandpa would have thought about such a thing.\\n\\nThe saw is light and vibration free. It\'s easy to handle and quick to rev. The 16\\" bar provides a nice reach yet with the .043 chain doesn\'t seem to big for the motor. I\'ve bogged it a couple times on some bigger situations but it hasn\'t happened enough to bother me. The quick chain adjust is also quite handy and easy to use.\\n\\nThe fuel tank is small and it does seem somewhat thirsty considering the small cc size, but it\'s not like you\'re filling up a Suburban. As of now the chain oiler seems a little aggressive also. Something that may or may not need looked yet, time will tell. Also there a couple times at idle for say about 20 seconds or so it stalled. The last time I used it, it did not do it. Not sure what changed other than break in.\\n\\nI think the 180 is worth the cost of upgrade from the 170. But if I had it to do over I might have sprung for the newer 211. I\'m satisfied with the 180, but the 211 is attractive also.\\n\\nI have two good Stihl dealers nearby.

The chain tension adjuster works well too. I liked not needing a tool that I\'d never have with me or would eventually lose. The saw is super light. As my first gas saw, I appreciated not having to struggle with a heavy saw.\\r\\n \\r\\nI took a star off because my saw came with a 16 inch bar and Stihl says you can cut using the whole bar. While technically true, I did not find this to be practical. With the whole bar in use, the engine would bog down and it would take a very long time to perform the cut, quickly emptying the small gas tank in the process. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need a saw for limbing or smaller trees, I would definitely recommend this saw. It worked great for branches/logs up to 10-12 inches. If you are doing bigger branches regularly, you should get a more powerful saw.

Although smaller than my old 036 that I was used to, I felt it performed as expected until....when the saw was hot it did not want to start, took it back to the dealer & they adjusted the carburetor, this helped slightly, but again the same problem, dropped off the saw & told them to search out the problem, being a mechanic there was no doubt this was a fuel related issue, they called later & said they found the carburetor had a vacuum leak & they were going to install a new carburetor, when I started to use it I noticed it lacked for fuel before it was really warmed up, adjusted the mixture on the carburetor myself, this solved the problem, after using the saw and heating it up I set it aside for the normal 15-20 minutes necessary to see if it would start which it barely did, after some further diagnosis it became evident that the saw (even when hot) must be on choke for 1-2 pulls until it \\"kicks\\" but then it must be put on 1/2 choke to start, this has solved my hot starting issue. The bottom line is this is a learning curve because of the new EPA changes for fuel consumption, the old ways of calculating if a saw needed extra fuel etc. to start simply don\'t apply with this design, the chain adjuster is really nice and otherwise I am pleased with my purchase."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I selected the Easy-Start feature and really like it except for one thing. If you forget and pull the starting rope with normal force the rope will break. A friend of mine had the same thing happen to him so I don\'t think it\'s just me. In my case, not only did the rope break but the interior spring that stores the energy (when you pull the rope out slowly like you\'re supposed to do) got all twisted and had to be replaced as well. \\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that either the rope or the internal components should be tough enough to forgive an occasional lapse of memory. After all, every other gas powered tool that I own is started with a fast pull and after starting gas engines for the past 60 years like that it\'s easy to forget that you only need a gentle pull on this machine.\\r\\nOther that that complaint, the saw is lightweight, runs and cuts smoothly and is a pleasure to use compared to a bigger, heavier saw."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Great saw, except for the space between the chain brake handle and the grab bar.

The pull start mechanism is spring loaded, so you can just gently pull the string and it will start with very little effort. It is not as expensive as I expected it to be.

The first job it had to tackle, however, was the felling of a (12 inch diameter at trunk base) ornamental cherry which had become diseased. It did the job, but by the time the tree was felled and pieced, and some additional light cutting was done, the chain had had it. A replacement chain, Stihl\'s own recommended part, experienced the same phenomenon. In the first case, once the chain became dull, the saw threw it and irrrevocably damaged the chain. In the second, it appears the chain will need sharpening much sooner than what I\'m used to.

As I said, I\'ve purchased used Stihl saws in the past, so I know what to expect.\\n\\nHere is my experience buying my first official chainsaw from Stihl:\\n\\nTook the saw home, checked everything and started it up myself. Chain came off. Realigned and retightened the chain. Started again. Chain came flying off. Took it in to the place I bought it from. Turned out the bolts holding the tensioner hadn\'t been completely tightened, hence why the chain came off no matter what I did. They fixed it (took them forever# and I made them start it up in front of me. Chain stayed on. Took it home, used it, and within five minutes the chainsaw would only stay on if I kept it throttled; letting it idle would shut it off. Checked the idle screw, WAY off. Not sure why considering it was fine at the store. Reset the idle screw properly.\\n\\nFive minutes of use and it happened again. Checked the idle screw. It had loosened again. Yes, Stihl saws should rev high - it\'s Stihl. But it shouldn\'t come loose after only five minutes. A day of hard work? Sure. Not five minutes. I\'m assuming the spring for the idle is off.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\nThe saw is lightweight and for its class its one heck of a saw. Cuts through just about anything quickly and efficiently. I can use it and not feel like my arm is going numb after an hour. I got the easy start model #highly recommend) and I\'m quite content with how easy it is to start the saw.\\n\\nCon:\\n\\nGetting it serviced is a pain. I\'ll be going to a different place to have it serviced after the issues from where I bought it. The loose bolts and idle problem is quite annoying, especially for the class of saw it is. I\'m a little concerned about longevity if I have had all of these problems within a month of purchase.\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nIf you are a homeowner or have a small to medium size property you need to do some work on, it\'s a good saw. Just make sure you have it thoroughly checked out before you travel with it like I did. Hopefully I\'m the odd case, but it does make me feel a bit disappointed given it was my first official purchase, especially with how my case was handled."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I put the new chain saw together and started it twice.

This Stihl struggles to go full throttle. Took it back the day I bought it and \\"tech\\" says that\'s all you\'ll get from it at full throttle. It basically sounds like it is grunting/lightly sputtering and that\'s what the tech said is normal. Therefore, it lacks what I\'d expect to be full power. Also, I took a chance and bought the model with the \\"tool-less\\" chain tightening. Poulan model I have is terrible, won\'t hold chain tight. The Stihl system is much better, but the chain loosens sooner than I\'d expect and not due to the chain stretching. Not as solid as the (slower) old-school tightening system."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"I bought this saw a couple of years ago and it worked great until the carb filled with saw dust.

The power and cutting ability is decent - way better than my older one I got from a big box store.\\n\\nI had a couple of problems with starting. The first was that I was flooding it. After viewing a few videos on the web about hard starting, I guess I was finally \\"let into the club\\" as one guy put it. Apparently since there is no priming bulb, the priming happens when you have it set to full choke. So no more than 2 pulls at full choke or you flood it (not sure if true, but it seems to work this way).\\n\\nThe other problem I had was with the easy start. A couple of weeks ago it wouldn\'t start. Nothing would happen when I pulled the cord. It\'s kind of hard to describe, but the easy start has this clip that pushes out when you pull the cord, and it uses a wound piece of metal to produce the tension before it releases to start it. I found that the piece of metal has a round furled end that sits in a hole in the plastic casing. The metal was coming out of the hole, so it wasn\'t catching the clips and winding. I took a finishing nail and pounded it into the end of the furled end to make it a bit bigger, and now it seems to stay put in the hole.\\n\\nWe\'ll see how long this fix lasts. I am also a bit conerned about the plastic wheel used to adjust the chain tension. It feels cheap, and doesn\'t really work very well, especially after you cut for a bit and debris gets on it. I end up just taking the cover off first, manually adjusting it with the metal wheel, and then putting the cover back on.\\n\\nThis is my first Stihl product, and I really want to think I am getting a lot of value for what I paid for it. I think the tension wheel and easy start are kind of consumer level \\"gimics\\". Over all I am happy with the performance, but we\'ll have to see about the long term reliability."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Well I had a issue on day one, recoil failed on 2 pull.

I have purchased many Stihl Products from Hi-Way 3 Hardware and currently own: MS 271 Chainsaw, FS 45 Weedeater, SH 56 C Leaf Blower with Gutter Extension, and MM 55 Mini Tiller. \\r\\nI purchased the MS 180 C-BE Chainsaw on 6/20/2016 while Hi-Way was waiting on parts for my MS271. When looking at the chainsaws available the Hi-Way 3 representative really pushed the MS 180 C-BE because he said it was a quality product. He also demonstrated the chain tightening mechanism that required \\"No Tools.\\" \\r\\nI brought the chainsaw home and had issues from the first time I used the machine. I found the \\"No Tools Required\\" bar/chain mechanism works it\'s way loose after 5-10 min of cutting, the quick release top cover randomly pops off when any branch barely touches the button, the lid to bar/chain oil randomly works it way loose and oil dumps all over the ground, and the lid to the fuel does the exact same thing. I noticed a notch in the top of the bar/chain lid and the fuel lid but I thought to myself, \\"no way they expect someone using this chainsaw to carry a screwdriver around just to refuel when the chainsaw is promoted for no requiring a screwdriver to loosen or remove the chain.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nOver the next 3 weeks of minimal use around our property, I had tons of recurring issues with this machine so I broke down and called Hi-Way 3 today. They asked me to bring the chainsaw into their store so they could check it out. Upon arrival, the Hi-Way 3 Hardware owner had an employee checkout the saw while I explained the issues I was having with the caps popping off, the cover coming loose, and the chain constantly loosening. I also explained that I felt the machine was of very low quality and poorly designed, but I would be willing to buy a different Stihl chainsaw from them if I could return this product. The owner agreed to let me return the horrifically designed MS 180 C-BE and she asked me which saw I wanted to purchase. I decided on the MS 251 as it is lightweight like the 180 but doesn\'t have all the \\"No Tools Required\\" design flaws. The Hi-Way 3 owner said, \\"Great, I will give you $120 for your MS 180 C-BE.\\" Needless to say, I was floored since I bought the saw 3 weeks ago and the product they sold me has very obvious design flaws. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, I buy Stihl because I know they\'re well made, built to last, and there is a local retailer that will stand behind the products. In this case, I didn\'t receive the Stihl quality I expect and the retailer showed absolutely no desire to stand behind a product that displays counter-intuitive design flaws which require a screwdriver to add oil and fuel but doesn\'t require tools to remove or tighten the bar and chain. In fact, the retailer made it very clear that, \\"she didn\'t design the MS 180 C-BE\\" and if I didn\'t agree with the design then I could contact the manufacturer. As a result, I am contacting Stihl with this complaint, posting this review on websites and social media, and recommending that readers purchase their yard equipment from a box store that will stand behind the products they sell."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"i have always bought stihl saw.\\nbut this model has gave me nothing but problems since i bought it 4 years ago.\\nbad saw."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Just bought this chainsaw.

Last weekend i used it for the 2nd time and had the same performance issues but this time i could not get the chainsaw to shut off when i turned it to the off position... Stihl is not an inexpensive product and I was really surprised to learn how limited their warranty is for a product that is supposed to be 2nd to none. I am pretty disappointed."},{"tags":["Unreliable","Difficult to Use","Difficult to Maintain"],"reviewText":"I bought a 180 in December 2019 just to do some light trimming and clean up on a 1 acre property as needed. My saw probably has 3 hours of run time and it is very finicky. Getting the saw to start is very inconsistent. When it does start it can run fine for a few minutes and then for some unknown reason just stops. I\'ve been running pre-mixed high octane fuel so that is not the issue. Air filter looks brand new. Cylinder looks brand new. Really disappointed.

Being a chainsaw that has many springs, especially with the so called easy start feature, I’m glad I got my refund and got a comparable priced Swedish saw that’s much better quality.

Always my fault. Pull start mechanism broke once, my fault. Chain came off bar and cut the plastic housing and bent the bar, my fault. Could not start many times. Last time took it in and was told this saw floods easily even tough I dried it out and even tried a new spark plug, certainly my fault. Since this incident I cranked it several times just to exercise it. This evening I got all set up to do some trimming and after second or third pull the \\"easy start\\"!!! broke again.

This saw has other great reviews, maybe I got a lemon. I bought it on 6/2/21 and used it for the first time on 6/22/21.

It will start, so its not flooded, it just runs rough and dies if you try to give it any throttle. After about 15 to 20 minutes it will run fine again until you shut it off. After about 3 rounds of this the pull cord snapped as well. I am familiar with the quick start process and was pulling straight up and not fully extending. I took it back that same day to the authorized dealer I purchased it from, but was advised their Stihl guy had quit and was directed to another location. It\'s still being repaired, was told Stihl will not replace an defective saw since they say it is warrantable and I should have been told not returnable. Come on Stihl, not cool. I didn\'t pay extra for a \\"Stihl\\" to have the quality and service of a box store no name brand saw. I have had to explain to multiple service representatives that the saw is not just flooded.

I did have some issues with the startup, as other users noted, as I could never get it started. I’d flood every time, but I had the dealer talked me through it, and realized I was cranking it too much on closed choke. All it takes is 1-2 pulls on closed choke, regardless if it burps or starts up, and then another 2 pulls on half choke. Since then and breaking it in, it takes 1 pull every time, and it’s dependable every time. Has great balance, plenty enough of power, and gives enough confidence and assurance it’ll get the job done."},{"tags":["Easy to Maintain","Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"Great firewood and cleanup saw, highly recommended. Have had 3 years, used on 3 ft dia. trees (most 12-18\\"), handles all well. Good power to weight ratio, reliable. Initially gave it 4 stars based on easy flooding and sometimes hard to start. Bought a cheap tach and tuned it myself for altitude. \\r\\n It now starts easily every time cold or hot, so am upgrading to 5 stars. \\r\\nI\'m cutting at 9,300 ft and dealer tuning was at store elevation of less than half that (running rich was not the saw\'s fault.)\\r\\nWhen cold: 2 pulls on full choke, 2 pulls on half choke and it\'s running hard.\\r\\nIf you have sufficient experience consider the 26 RS 68 Super Chisel chain. The 250 really rips with that chain but is a bit less forgiving of sloppy bar nose control than with the green low-kick back chain. \\r\\nHave run 2+ gallons of bar oil through it, however much wood that is.

It needed the muffler repaired but has worked flawless for many years. My dad bought it new. I was looking for a smaller saw as the old 032 can be a real back breaker after a while. They recommended the MS250. Size was right and the price was right. After reading a few reviews I decided to get it. So far so good. Starts every time and that seems to be the bulk of any negative reviews that are posted. I don’t use Stihl oil. I use AMSOIL Sabre 2 cycle oil in everything.

I bought it originally to cut up a big Pecan limb (about 16\\" dia) that had broken off and it cut it up with no problem. Then last fall I had a big Oak fall in the yard (about 30\\" dia) and it had no issues with it. Sure, it would\'ve probably been a little easier with a bigger saw since I had to cut 2/3 of the way through and then switch sides to get the rest, but I was really impressed with this thing\'s power on a tree of this size.\\r\\n\\r\\nI recently had three more trees fall in the backyard and have already taken care of one and will be finishing up this week.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want a small, light-weight, powerful saw for a good price, this is a solid choice or has been for me.

After using the saw for a couple of weeks for limning and clearing of trees that I cut down earlier in the summer, I\'ve noted a couple of things I thought should be included in a well informed review. First, this saw is awesome. It cuts like no other 18\\" saw I\'ve owned before (I\'ve owned three). It has all of the power I need for what I\'m using it for (fire wood, clearing, limning). I can\'t say enough about the new low-kick chain that came with it. It is truly a pleasure to use, and I feel safer than I did with my old craftsman (near death experience). Now there are quite a few reviews talking about hard starting with this saw. I experienced this when I first tried to start it as well. So this is what I learned, this saw is very touchy when using the full choke at cold starts. The guy\'s who sold it to me recommended to use no more than 6 pulls on full, or it would flood. With this saw, it seems to flood after 3 pulls, so I started only pulling once, then going to half choke for two to three pulls. This has been my standard cold starting procedure every since, and it works flawlessly. Second, people have stated that it will run rough or even die after a bit of use (fifteen to twenty mins.). It happened to me too. After reading some more reviews, it turned out to be the spark plug. I purchased a four pack of NGK (6703) plugs, and have not replaced it since, and seems to run way smoother, and no longer dies. The Bosch plugs that they come with now, don\'t seem to stand up to the heat like the NGK\'s do. I use these in my Stihl blower as well. Finally, the only other problem I\'ve had with this saw, is that it will sometimes die while sitting on the ground with the chain brake on while warming up. Once again back to the reviewers. It turns out that ALL of their saws, not just this one, have the same brake mechanism, and as such are designed to over power the brake at idle, which causes friction, and in turn over heats the engine. So mine was dying (those darn Bosch plugs :), basically to save the engine from catastrophic failure. If these engines over heat to much, then scoring of the cylinders can occur, which means boom NEW ENGINE! So once I get the saw started I release the brake and then set it on the ground for a couple of minutes. To test that theory, I actually let it sit for about 25 mins. on the ground, and it never died, but with the brake on, it dies within a couple of minutes. They are generally warm after a couple mins.of running anyway. I\'ve read a lot of reviews on a lot of products, but sometimes you read from people who\'ve lived the life and work, and you just kind of know they are telling you the truth. Anyway, that\'s how I learned about this saw, and this has been my experience with this saw. I\'ve recommended it to several people who\'ve purchased it, and they are very happy with them. After buying several other Stihl products, I know that Stihl is still a name you can still trust. Trust me, I\'m a reviewer. :)"},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I bought this a month ago and it is everything it says it will be. Start up is a breeze.

I had considered the 241-CM, but couldn\'t justify the pro saw for only a dozen trees a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, the MS-250 is a powerful, lightweight saw that chews thru trees and runs reliably - but you gotta follow the starting procedure (have the dealer show you a cold start on a cold saw). I\'ve cut up at least 30 trees in this time, working on various projects and only experienced an issue once - which turns out, was my fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy one fail was after a winter 3 months of no use. I pulled it out Friday night, to prep it & check the chain for a Saturday tree project. It wouldn\'t start. After scratching my head, I realized I had done it wrong. I pulled the plug, dried it out, went to get a water, then returned to the saw. This time, Full Choke 2 pulls and the familiar pop, finger pull 1/2 choke, 2 pulls and there\'s that happy growl. I let it run until it was hot then shut it off. The next day, it worked perfectly following the same start up. I (we) took down 6 mid-sized trees (I let my sons do the 100+ cuts - much easier)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter cleaning up the saw, I took a sharpie and wrote on the cover (2 - choke, 2 -1/2 choke) as a reminder that this saw is a little particular about how you start it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI keep it fed with only Stihl Mix and Ultra oil. I blow it out with compressed air after each day of use. I use the Stihl sharpener (great tool that touches the tooth and rake) and keep chains very sharp - I love seeing the long curls from the pro chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPowerful, Lightweight. Once it\'s hot it\'ll start with one pull every time. I\'ve used the saw more than I thought I would - and it\'s performed like a champ.

Full choke, 3 or 4 pulls until it sputters. Half choke and 2 or 3 more pulls until she fires. If it sits in the cold for a little bit after usage, maybe half choke starts. It can be a bear to start if it is run completely out of fuel, but after a while you develop an ear where you can hear the saw lean out from low fuel.

My MS 250 has never once failed to start using the steps outlined in the O/M... set the control to Full Choke, then with 1 or 2 pulls on the recoil, listen for the \'pop\'. Then move the control to Half Choke and with 1 or 2 pulls, it fires right up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother key to reliable & easy starting is using fresh non-ethanol 90 PON gasoline, mixed with Sthil HP oil.

If you have already flooded it, remove the spark plug, dry it off, and crank it several times with the spark plug out as per the manual to get the excess fuel out. LET IT SITE FOR 20 MINUTES, Crank it once or twice on full choke. Then crank it several times on half choke.

My dad bought a few Stihl products back in the early 80\'s and they were junk but I think that must have been a glitch. The stuff they are turning out now is built very well. I purchased a new Stihl weedeater in 2007 and have been very pleased with it. It\'s very reliable and low maintenance. That got me to thinking about going with another Stihl product.\\n\\nI had initially picked out the MS-291 and almost bought one. I went to a local dealer and they had the 291 and 250 on the shelf. There is a noticeable difference between the two in terms of weight. I think after cutting a few logs for firewood you will start feeling the difference in the weight so I went with the 250. All I use a chainsaw for is to cut firewood and clear out trails for my four wheeler. The salesman at the local Stihl dealership recommended the 250 and I think it\'s been a good choice. I used it last week to remove a large tree stump (3\' in diameter) and it didn\'t have any trouble chewing through that. My saw came with an 18\\" bar and was told by my salesman that it would pull a 20\\" bar no problem. An 18\\" bar is good enough for my needs. I bought a case to put my saw in and it fits perfectly on the front of my four wheeler. This saw feels great in my hands and there is no comparison between it and the old Craftsman saw.

If something were to happen to mine I would buy another one just like it, but not before buying another XL (if I could) one of the best things about my Still purchase was with the additional purchase of a six pack synthetic oil mix they exteded my warranty for a second year.

But readiing some of the other reviews prompted me to submit this one. My dad bought this saw new a number of years ago (5-7), and I bought it from him 3-4 years ago when he got a new MS250 with the Easy2Start feature due to his arthritis.\\n\\nThis 250 has been a flawless performer period. I use it for limbing and smaller tree work...up to 12, maybe 14 inch hardwood for the most part. If someone has issues with their saw starting and running properly, it needs to be tuned or re-tuned properly by someone qualified to do that. Also make sure you`re using high quality gasoline...it all makes a big difference. If your saw does not cut properly...the chain needs attention. A sharp chain is imperative to proper cutting. A dull chain does nothing but wear the operater out and prematurely wears the chain & bar,and or saw out. If you get the chain into dirty wood or just plain into dirt, spend a few minutes and re-sharpen it then and there. The time investment will pay back handsomely. I supply the wood for 2 families for winter heating, all hardwood, and this saw goes with me absolutely everytime I go to the woods. I would not be without it. I have larger saws, Stihl or course, for the bigger work. Just make sure you get the right saw for the job, and you should not be dissappointed."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Have had this saw for two years and loving every moment of it. Made the mistake of buying an Echo not a bad saw but nothing compared to this (price to price). Thank you for who ever stole it out of my truck blessing in disguise. My Dad is a Stihl fan should have taken his unspoken advice. The Saw is strong in every area power, performance, ease of maintanance and use, etc. The saw is sensitive to start and high compression but once you got it. (If the compression is an issue you can get the 250 C model) You will never have a problem again. Run fresh gas mix 89 or better and you can never go wrong. Use only Stihl Bar and Chain Oil had to buy some other brand once said premium on the bottle cost a couple bucks less but made my chain a mess and Bar was being starved for oil. Its a perfect package for the novice to intermediate woodsman. I run the 18\\" bar if you run it balls to the wall every time no issues. The only thing i would ask for would be an oil adjustment option (due to inferior brands of oil out there) and a sight line like my other saws used a marker but not as aesthetically pleasing as Stihl does it.

After much fiddling around per instructions, I just decided to change the spark plug, and air filter.

That\'s a sign to replace the air filter; I can even notice the RPM drop when reinstalling a clogged air filter, when it is idling; if severe clogging, will even stall the engine. Been trying to figure a good way to wash the air filter clean, so as not needing to replace it so often. I\'m thinking the cooling air is drawn up through the air filter area of the engine, since there is a plastic cover, over the carb intake. I think this is a design flaw, and probably could be improved to draw air separately from the cooling air. When cutting up a stump, there is a lot more dust sucked in the cooling air flow.\\r\\n\\r\\nDealer recommended using a tune up kit, to replace the spark plug, air filter and fuel filter, all at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did learn one further item in this forum; I typically use Octane 87, which works well.

The 250 is one of my favorite saws made and hands down my favorite homeowners saw. I just purchased a new one this week to keep around the house. Super easy to start. Super easy to operate. Great power to weight ratio. The 250 is exceptionally powerful and I suspect the hp rating is well under its true output. Everything about the saw I really love with only 1 exception, on my previous 250, the handlebar mount just below the felling dogs would occasionally come out when I was rough/abusive to the saw. The new one appears to be the same design. (I recognize this is only when abused but I have become spoiled/accustomed to having the luxury of being able to abuse my Stihl saws without consequence.) In my experience, you should expect about 2000 work hours of reliable usage from this saw. Proper maintenance is key and long term fuel storage can cause issues so don\'t leave fuel in the tank or carb. I suspect the folks posting negative reviews are having issues because of operator error since I have successfully worn out multiple Stihl chainsaws, including a 250, and never had the issues described.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide note: I originally tried the 250 as a replacement for the 260.

That in and of itself says a lot; the saw is top notch, the chains are reliable and durable, the oiler works properly, tensioning the chain is easy (I prefer the tool versus the \\"quick release\\" style in the higher up models) and what else?

I use it for clearing my property of trees, limbing, and cutting firewood rounds. This saw doesn\'t disappoint and starts on the 2nd to third pull for me (generally the second).\\r\\n\\r\\n This little monster has torn through some large Eastern Red Oak rounds (24\\" diameter) with no issues or bogging down and is a little powerhouse.

If I was using it everyday I would upgrade to a more professional saw. I give it top ratings for being powerful and lightweight, and for giving a good value. Cold starting requires the right technique. Never pull more than once on full choke! If it doesn\'t start afterwards on half-choke after a few pulls, then give one more pull at full choke. It will never start on full choke, but that is how you prime the engine. Using this technique it has been quite dependable."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Brand new saw, not my 1st.

My dealer takes out the plug and blows the gas out of the crankcase. Sorry, I just dont take a gas compressor into the woods. Maybe Stihl will put the bulb primer on a convential saw without that flimsy, easily broken chain adjustment dial system that needs tools not fingers to adjust. Other than that, when running, my new 250 is a peach,.plenty of power and starts great when hot. If it cools ...see the above."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Great chainsaw! I just bought this two weeks ago. Initially I had a hard time starting it, I ended up flooding it.

Once I got the process down it is easy to start. I used it on and off for 7 hours in one day, it started easily, no matter how short or long the rest was in between uses. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn operation it easily cut through the smaller trees I cut down (12 inches in diameter), no bogging.

Great fuel economy and easy on bar/chain oil as well. I have used it at sea level and at high elevations while preparing firewood for a camping trip in the sierras and while I was nervous that the saw wouldn\'t perform at 9000 ft and leave us cold, it started right up and ran like a top. Great power to weight ratio, well balanced and very reliable.\\n\\nMy complaints are with the fuel and oil caps randomly leaking and also with the air filter material/design. I always wipe my saw down before adding oil or fuel so the caps are clean when I re-install and for some odd reason, they will occasionally leak. The air filter media seems to be too coarse as have found very fine sawdust on the clean side of the air filter.

If you do your part the saw will do it’s part. I have seen a lot of people writing about this particular saw flooding a lot. I will say this is true, it’s easy to flood. The saw always starts great from the cold condition, yet can stumble when starting warm. If you have a hard time getting it to fired up then do the following. First check the muffler. Do you see gas? If the answer is yes it’s flooded. Is the spark plug wet? If the answer is yes it’s flooded. How do you correct this? Turn the choke off and open the throttle. Pull the starter until it fires up. Sometimes this can take some effort if you flooded it excessively. If after 20-30 pulls it doesn’t start then you may well have mechanical issues (it’s very rare that this doesn’t work). Once you have some time invested in this model you’ll have no issues firing it up. Be conservative when starting this saw warm and you’ll be in business.

If you don\'t catch the choke at the right time during start-up, it will flood out. The instruction manual is very clear on how to prevent this but because it\'s a hard cranking chainsaw to start, it sometimes is difficult to catch the choke in time. That said, the instructions state to remove the spark plug, pull the crank a few time to clear any fuel from the cylinder, replace and properly torque the spark plug. Then set the choke in the correct position and attempt to start the saw; that works perfectly. Sounds like a lot but it\'s a relatively simple process. Now that I\'ve routinely used it over 75 times since I purchased it last year, no issues. Chain adjustments are a little more frequent than I expected but that\'s the reality of just about any chainsaw. Overall, this is a great product, cuts quickly and effortlessly.

Besides a few little pinches with clearing bundles of brush, there were no issues at all. It chewed through the larger pine trees as well. The only issue I experience was having a little difficulty adjusting the tension on the chain. I might have forgot what I read and saw with the video but I had to loosen the bar to where it was free moving and adjust the tension of the chain. If the nuts were tight that hold the bar, the tension screw didn\'t adjust anything. But, this wasn\'t a big deal. Overall, this is a great product with plenty of power.

I\'ve learned the hard way, never to fill the oil and gas immediately before use, because tipping the saw on its side is guaranteed to make it flood and not start.

However I\'ve never had a chainsaw so hard to start ! It is so extremely hard to pull to start ,it\'s ridiculous . A size 12 work boot will not fit in the handle when it\'s on the ground. Secondly it floods instantly. You can\'t put it on full choke until it burps. It\'ll flood. One or two pulls only on full choke then switch to half choke and it will eventually start,that is if your arm doesn\'t give out first. Once it warms up, It\'s a GREAT running saw.

I was worried the MS-251 plastic thumbwheel chain tensioner would not hold up, so I went with the older MS-250 model. Once you get it running, it runs fine, but it is a bear to start. It floods and then you have to remove the spark plug and pull the cord to remove some of the fuel before putting the plug back in. Even after running through a tank of fuel, it does not immediately start up. You still need to choke it. Worse yet, the chain tensioning nuts keep vibrating loose, and I have read of many people stripping the studs trying to keep the nuts on. So, without even running the MS-251, I would buy that newer model over the older MS-250 if I could do it over. It is supposedly much easier to start and is more fuel efficient. The chain tensioner cannot be any worse than the one on the MS-250, so go with the new model if you are leaning towards a Stihl saw in this category."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"This saw runs and cuts great but it is very hard to start.

Bigger limbs require a good bit of relief cutting, particularly when dealing anything much over 8” in diameter. \\r\\n\\r\\nI ended up trading our MS-250 in on a competitor’s product with a 60 cc engine and, not surprisingly, am seeing dramatically faster results on much heavier timber.

I went to start it again the next day, and there was a substantial amount of black oil leaking from the seams on the muffler. I\'m no expert, but that usually means its running too rich, or a gasket is blown (regardless not something I want out of a brand spanking new piece of equipment). The only person (which I consulted many) that told me this was normal was the stihl dealer. Before I even used it, I had made the decision to trade it in for a more reliable saw that doesn\'t have a reputation for being difficult and problematic.

Just over 3 years ago i purchased this MS 250. It worked great for about 4 days, then it stopped running. Took it back to the dealer. They found that the coil had gone bad and replaced it. By the way the dealer i go to is great. They are top of the line and know their stuff. Very good people to deal with I give them a CLASS A rating and they get the saw running again every time. The saw worked great after that other than the bar oil leaked all the time. They said that is normal and that it will stop when the saw cools off after use. Well it don\'t, it leaks all the time and it makes no difference if you lay it on it side or sit it upright. I put two towels under it and it leaks through them. It is hard to start and floods easy. Even with one pull on full chock and one pull on half chock. They said it might be bad gas,i use the Motomix fuel. When it does start it tries to spit and sputter as soon as you touch the throttle, most of the time it cuts off at that point. Last June the same thing all over again and the plastic side chain case crack. I bought a new cover and had the carb cleaned by the dealer. With in two days the problem is back. I cleaned out the gas tank put new fuel filter in it change the fuel lines, air filter and return fuel line and change the plug 2 times a year. Still no help. When it does run i clean the saw inside and out before i put it up and run the gas out so the gas won\'t go bad in the saw. The saw never sits more than two weeks at a time without use. I should have got a pro saw instead of this one. It\'s been in the dealers 6 times for the same thing. Then they tell me that i may be trying to start it wrong. I read the manual several times thinking i missed something. Starting this saw is not a big deal. I just got back from the dealer today for the same thing again.

(Original purchase date was March 2014, replacement saw was last fall).\\r\\n\\r\\nI used the saw in the fall for about one tank of fuel, and then filled it with Stihl Motomix, and stored it in my house, not in the damp cellar. This Spring, I started using it and the same exact problem is back. This saw has yet to have three tanks of fuel go through it. My Girlfriend purchased the Stihl oil when she purchased the saw, extending the warranty to two years. I just now took the saw to another Stihl dealer other than where I purchased it, (I am moving, and frankly was not going to travel the distance to the original dealership and lose three weeks again), and was told the warranty had expired, and that the two year warranty applies to the original purchase date, not the replacement date. Last year I stopped in at yet another Stihl dealer close to home, and was told they would not do warranty work unless I produced the receipt and the warranty card, even though Stihl told me all you need to do is provide a serial number. It seems everywhere I go, the dealers have different answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am moving to a new home this week, and the first order of business was clearing several fallen trees from a recent storm. It looks as if I will have to purchase a new saw, or pay to have this one fixed, or rent one.

They got so hot that the Bar & chain oil was jet black! We let them cool then kept on. Same thing. Now the MS 251 is seized up tight and I can tell the 250 is not far behind. As a note, the MS 251 is two weeks old and the MS 250 is just over a year old. I am so disappointed in Sthil!

I own plenty of other stihl tools that work great, however due to the frustration of no support, and now have to buy a used saw, I will no longer be a stihl customer. The MS250 is a LEMON!!! thanks for nothing."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I recently purchased a new MS 250 Chainsaw after running a 025 for 20 years. I used it the day i purchased it for about three hours. Two weeks later, I picked it up to cut a few saplings and it would not start. Returned it to the dealer on a Saturday afternoon. One week later, I stopped by the dealer and they still had not gotten it started. They had replaced the carburetor and it still would not start. They told me they were waiting on a compression tester from their other store and would give me a call. No call. One week later (2 weeks in the shop) I stopped again to check on the status. Salesperson said the saw was on the tech\'s work bench and they would call. No call! I have been a loyal Stihl customer. I have 6 Stihl power tools at home and several more at work that I have been responsible for the purchase. I have been a loyal customer for 20 years. But this need to be corrected. At the very least the MS 250 should be replaced with a new one that works or my money refunded."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"I bought it because of the reputation. The saw will not start.

I choked it and pulled one time then switched it up to the start position and pulled forever but it did not start. I then let it stand for over an hour and used another saw. Later I choked it and pulled it two times then, swtiched it up to the start position and pulled it about 40 times and it finally started. After setting overnight I choked it and pulled it three timed then swtiched it up to start position and pulled it forever but no luck. Once it was started it ran really great UNTIL I had to stop for a refuel , then back to square one with a difficult starting it. Also , when I switched it to off it would not shut off because the Kill wire would come off of the switch beneath the cover.

Took it back only to be THEN informed we had 7 days to get a refund! It’s a garbage unit! It takes about a dozen pulls to start. From day one it leaked bar oil.

The oil cap leaks CONSTANTLY. The \\"easy start\\" system doesn\'t always work.\\n\\nOverall for the price, I would not recommend purchasing this saw.

They said they would work on the carb, because sometimes they have problems from sitting too long. I picked it up a couple of days later and tried to start it as soon as I got home and it would not start. After trying again the next day, I returned it to the dealer and got my money back. They said this is the best saw made, so I showed him all of the reviews regarding the starting problem and told them Stihl has a quality problem if every fifth reviewer has starting issues. To those of you with a 5 star rating, I say great, I’m glad you got a good one. But ask yourself this, would you buy a new car or motorcycle if 15% of that model didn’t start.

As per usual they start reliably and run like champs. Unfortunately, I didn\'t clean the saw and wore a hole through the plastic body and caused an oil leak. Replaced with a MS 251 C-BE for two months. Found the new 251 C-BE to feel cheap compared to the older saws, power was better, but the chain tensioning and mount felt flimsy. Sold the MS 251 C-BE to a friend who has a much smaller yard and need and bought the MS261. It is simply amazing how much better the MS261 is compared to the Farm and Ranch saws. The power to weight ratio makes this saw so much better to work with."},{"tags":["Easy to Use"],"reviewText":"No bad choices between MS261 and FarmBoss; however I bought the slightly more expensive MS261 after the truly excellent Sthil rep in McLean Hardware, Virgina took both apart on his in store workbench, and explained the differences. The MS261 is lighter because of higher grade lightweight metal construction, it has a decompression valve feature that makes the first pull start easier, and has a separate gear drive that can meet easily be replaced over time. AlthoughFarmBoss has the catchy name and more advertising, you get better value for money with the “one grade up” in professional class of MS261.

To be fair I have another saw that is a bit larger and more powerful to more safely fell the large trees I come across. However, once the tree is down, I run the 261 to break the tree up because it has plenty of power and is very light. \\r\\nCons - The trigger/throttle mechanism can be improved.

I never have had any repairs on my 048 other than fuel lines when I foolishly ran some ethanol gas in it. My next saw was an 024 for liming and cutout. I bought the 024 in the 1980\'s and used both in the woods and home use. It has never had any repairs and like it as it is so much lighter than my 048. Last year I bought the MS 261, I had the dealer put a 16 bar and the same type of chain that I have on my 024 in order to keep the number of different chain sizes down. It will easily handle an 18 if I wanted it to. It has gobs of power and weighs about the same as my 024. It took a while to get used to starting it with the compression release, but after I got used to it, it\'s super easy. I notice when I\'m working them both the 261 uses less gas and less chain oil than my 024. I have a lot of blow down trees and use my 261 for dropping and cutting the trunk into sections, and my 024 is at my brush piles for liming and making the sections pileable .

The oiler did not work right out of the box, and it was assembled correctly. Two things were wrong, the premium oil was too thick to prime the pump., I got it going with thin motor oil, however the oiler set to maximum does not provide enough oil to adequately lube the chain. This will cause premature wear on both chain and bar!

I know the whole deal with the ethanol and I use as much ethanol free as I can but I expected alot trouble free use from a professional model saw. Instead of putting Stihl replacement parts in my shop recommended another replacement part(s) that they have been using for about 2/3 the cost.

Ten tanks of fuel so far this winter without a hitch. Starts cold, hot, and in-between. Light enough to use recently on father-in-law\'s garage to clear overgrown trees and worked great also in dense brush with 2-6 inch trunks. Tough enough to cut through countless large tree trunks for firewood. What a pleasure it is to not have to fight a saw or wonder if it will start or how long it will run.

Enough power to cut through a lot of the fallen and dying small (~4\\") to medium (~10\\") trees on the property I manage without bogging down. Obviously this is not a saw for older trees, but I have used it in a pinch and it\'s held up fine. The only issues I have seen with these saws is the small plastic flag that locks the choke open can sometimes break if you put a lot of force on the choke lever and the chain dulls fairly quickly (I don\'t have the time to sharpen my chain after each use, although it\'s a practice I should make a habit.). I only found one other thing I dislike which is the 16\\" bar. For what I and most others use this saw for I think a 14\\" bar would be better. It\'s really not a big deal, but I will be purchasing a smaller bar and chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall I have found this saw to be super helpful.

The saw is light and easy to handle and great for trimming and small jobs. You are not going to cut a winter’s worth of wood with this saw even though it comes with a 16\\" bar. I have not had any problems starting the saw, a few pulls, even if it is cold, and it fires right up. I do question the oiling dependability, especially in colder weather. The oil reservoir is inconsistently at different levels between fueling up. I will be taking this back in to see if it is a mechanical issue. The toolless features on this saw are awesome. The anti vibration system on this saw with the light weight will let you work all day, which you may need since you will have to work twice as long to get any amount of work done on bigger projects.\\n\\nI do recomend this product since it is is a great saw for light work.

She called me and asked me if that was ok and I said it was. I currently own an MS 660, an 028 and an MS 180 C-BE. The MS 181 C-BE is supposed to be low emission and eco friendly. It probably is and it was a tad lighter than the MS 180 C-BE but it wasn’t even close to the 180 in regard to power. The chain speed was slower than the 180, the power was significantly less than the 180 and for some reason the MS 181 C-BE kept dying after it got warmed up and I made a cut that put the saw under a decent load. I have a feeling that the measures taken to create a low emission product have compromised the quality, power and dependability in the case of the MS 181 C-BE. I could tell a noticeable difference in the feel and design of the MS 181 C-BE and if I had been blindfolded, I never would have guessed that it was a Stihl just based on the feel of it. Also, this was the first Stihl chainsaw I have ever used that had a fuel priming bulb on it, which didn’t excite me as it is just one more part that is sure to need replaced. I am not a brand junky when it comes to tools but I generally stick with what is reliable. My 028 was purchased by my father about thirty years ago and is still as reliable as it was when it was new. I have only had this one poor experience with a Stihl product and it won’t turn me away from the brand but I did return (with no issues at all) the MS 181 C-BE and I purchased another MS 180 C-BE at a different dealer in town.

It has power and long battery life. Love when I press the button it starts up immediately! At 73 years young, I don\'t miss the pull-and-tug of a gas sawat all and I have owned several. The 14\\" bar and chain combination is more than enough to tackle the cutting needs around my place. With 300+ trees on the property, there is always a necessity for cutting and trimming.

Great saw and I highly recommend it!"},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I bought my first chainsaw 2 weeks ago and have used it on two Saturdays and it has been great. Quiet for the historic neighborhood that the property is located, and charge on batteries lasted 45 minutes to an hour depending on number of cuts and size of trees. Recharged within 35-45 minutes. I bought two batteries so as to cut while other is being recharged. Very pleased with the capabilities and my father who is a seasoned chainsaw user was equally impressed. Bought protective gloves, chaps, and helmet with ear protection also from Runyon Tool who was great to deal with during the Covid-19 pandemic."},{"tags":["Easy to Maintain","Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I am hard on my tools so I hope this one holds up.

It cuts clean and fast with less waste and is a pleasure to use. I bought this after ruining a gas saw and am so happy not to have to deal with that anymore. I went with the newest battery and best charger. It charges so fast it won’t be a problem for me around the homestead. I am happy with the time I get on one charge. I won’t usually cut a oak as big as the one in the picture but nice to know I can. Used the tractor to roll over the last piece of trunk.

We were both very surprised at how much power and cutting ability this saw had... for a battery powered saw. It\'s lite enough that she can handle it with ease, ~11 lbs with the battery, and a single charge will limb several trees. We upgraded on the charger to get the quick charge option, and it\'s very convenient that the batteries are fully charged before we need them as the battery life/run time is impressive. The tool less maintenance is also beneficial as we can grab the saw, an extra battery, and some bar oil and head off in the woods for hours... no tools or excess equipment to bring along. I would definitely recommend this saw to others, lightweight, powerful and fast cutting. A bit pricey, but at the end of the day you get what you pay for."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"It\'s small and light, no mixing fuel or pulling a rope. The torque of the electric motor feels stronger than a similar sized gas saw. Each battery lasts about as long as a tank of gas. I am a Land Surveyor and occasionally have to cut a sight line.

I would buy it again."},{"tags":["Easy to Maintain","Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"This is a surprisingly good chain saw. I just did not want to buy a saw that I would use occasionally for small trees and limbs and to have to deal with storing and mixing gas and all of the maintenance and start up required to keep the saw in order. Now, when I want to cut something, grab the saw, cut, and store the saw. The battery system seems very stable, The charger and extended battery work hand in hand to keep the battery ready to go, but not overcharge it. Pull the battery out of the charger, and pop it in the saw and you are running. If you need to transport the saw and battery without the charger, there is a back-out position of the battery so that it is in the saw\'s battery sleeve, but not making contact. There are some nice safety features that you would expect from Stihl - like the chain brake - which are very easy to engage/disengage and well thought out.\\r\\nI paid more for this than for competitive products, but like I said, Stihl just seems to get it right."},{"tags":["Easy to Maintain","Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"This is a great little saw that is a real performer. Don\'t expect it to be equivalent to a gas engine powered saw but it has its own advantages. Working off a ladder or platform lift is easier. NO noise to annoy nearby neighbors. No gasoline smell in the back of my Jeep when I take it with me 4 wheeling. Small chain size ideal for carving logs for decorative architectural trim. Long lasting battery life is good for back woods trail maintenance where noise is an annoyance to others.

It had plenty of power for my job (5-10\\" diameter tree branches) and it was so convenient to use. Previously I had a gas powered chainsaw that took 30 minutes to get fired up, followed by an electric chain saw that needed 200 feet of electrical cable (20 minutes) in order to get to all the areas of my backyard.

Two months later, I\'ve nearly retired by gas-powered chainsaw because the electric chainsaw is fantastic. Quiet, powerful, instant start and stop, lighter weight. I love that when I take my finger off the button it shuts off and is completely quiet. The thinner chain is easier and faster to sharpen, and still cuts very fast. I get about 30 minutes of run-time from a charge, which can often be 1-1.5 hours of working time. Recharge time is about 40 minutes.

These tools will not leave you questioning your decision."}],"conReviews":[{"tags":[],"reviewText":"First off. I have owned several Stihl products and have loved the quality and performance of all of them. Now for the good stuff. This is my first electric battery powered chainsaw. I was a huge sceptic at first, knowing that I needed a new chainsaw, but was afraid to venture out to something with new technology. The weight is fabulous! Very light and very nimble. I opted for a 14\\" blade which does all of my yard work and most of my 4-Wheeling downed trees across the trail. The power is something considerable to a 300 series gas when in altitude except there is no loss of HP even at 11,000 ft! The batteries tend to last about 30-40 mins when constantly cutting but will last me all day when working outside. I carry 2 batteries and charges take a little over an hour each from dead. I would recommend 3 batteries if your going to cut non-stop all day so they each have time to charge. One note on the batteries though, is that 3 or 4 bars equals full power but 1-2 has limited torque and can only be used for cutting small branches, etc. The best part of the saw is the ability to just pick it up and cut...then set right back down...no starting or yanking the cord constantly and shutting off or waiting to warm up. My only real complaint is that I wish they made a slightly bigger saw for larger trees with a 16\\" or 18\\" bar but so far...I have only ran into needing a larger blade once. I also wish I had a better selection of chains to choose from as there is only one. If does cut very fine and sometimes I need a chipper.\\r\\nOverall. I would say, buy this saw if you want to carry on your ATV or Jeep or need a small saw for working around your property.(No keeping extra fuel onboard and risk of leakage). I would not buy this for a primary wood cutting saw but everything else. Ill leave those days to my 460!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"High on quality, torque, and ease of use.

I heat my off-grid home with wood, and burn about 2 cords a year. After a couple afternoons in the woods I am convinced I will easily be able to cut all the wood I will need with this saw. It is a nice light saw, weighing 11.5 lbs with everything, including an AP 180 battery. As others have mentioned, it is very quiet, and the lack of a gas engine should make it very hassle free to maintain. There is also a lot less vibration, and the fact that it is always on makes it really simple to set it aside and pick it right back up and start cutting. The batteries have a lot of power, but will drain down pretty fast if you simply stand and make repetitive cuts. I would say you could probably drain a battery in 20 minutes if you were just standing at a sawhorse cutting non-stop, but I could easily fell and limb and drag slash with this thing for an hour or two making only the occasional cut. I am using the AL 300 charger and I would say that you need 30 minutes to get 80% and about 45 to get a pack up to 100 from having around 25% remaining. (The included literature does not give much detail about how to prolong the life of your batteries, but my understanding of Lithium Ion batteries in general is that more frequent smaller chargings are better than really deep discharges). I obviously have not had the saw long enough to really say much about its drawbacks (other than its fairly high price), but one thing that I had not really thought much about was that it is not designed to be used in the rain. I look forward to putting some mileage on it this winter and getting some more experience with what I believe is a promising new piece of technology."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"Definitely great power to get the job done.

This saw cut them like butter. I had the whole tree cut into 16” logs in about ten minutes. Comparing this saw to others i’ve used in the same bar length and saw size, this is as good as any I’ve ever used, electric or gas powered. I called my dad just to tell him the next time he’s wood cutting smaller stuff he has to borrow this saw and try it out. If you are cutting logs small enough that you only have to split them once to make firewood this thing is a champ. PLUS you can pick it up overhead and no chainsaw exhaust in your face.

I only engaged the locking mode if children were present so it was used only a couple of times. About April of 2019 on my third use of the CS the whole thing locked up. I took it to my local dealer and they fixed it without much of an explanation, “it locked up they said.” I tried to use it again in September ( my second use) and it locked up once more. A quick fix and I tried again in the next week, another lock down. This time however they told me that it was toast.

This saw replaces my old 026 and is a lot more powerful. Really like the simple and quick 3 fastener lugs to get at the filter. The filter is a huge improvement as it is a simple round filter which attaches to the carburetor with a quick 1/4 turn spin on. The design is also much improved as very little sawdust gets into this compartment. The electronic carburetor adjustment is also a big help as it adjusts automatically to weather conditions. The only down side is the oil filler plug. It is a sawdust magnet and with all the nooks and cranny\'s its a pain in the butt to clean off and prevent all sorts of junk from getting into the oil tank.

Hands down this one keeps coming up as a favorite.Worth every penny. I found the most versatile is this saw with a 18\\" bar. Tried a 251 (lacked power, trigger was terrible). Tried a 271, extremely heavy. Tried a MS311, make 4 cuts and put it down; way too heavy but liked the 20\\" bar. This one is 10.8lb and has a lot of power. \\r\\n\\r\\nDefinitely recommend the pro model. It is a one time buy. The trigger is much smoother than the others i have tried. The decompression valve is fun to used but unnecessary. When you don\'t realize your using a product, it is doing it\'s job. The M tronic is a nice feature but unnecessary; i haven\'t noticed and likely will not. I like the pro engine this has too. Grab a paint brush and wipe off the cap b/f refilling, so as to not plug your fuel solenoid. Crank the oiler up to max and refill it with each fuel fill-up; the saw is shipped with the oiler adjustment in the middle, but the new chain instructions say to max out the oiler to break in the chain. had to call Stihl tech support to understand break in and how to select the saw b/c all 3 dealers in my area knew significantly less than I didn\'t about the product, and this was my first saw purchase."},{"tags":["Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I bought the 261 c three weeks ago right after got it had a ice storm,numerous trees down.

Seemed like a good compromise for an all purpose truck saw.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough other saws were always used regularly for firewood, trail clearing, felling, building, etc....this one with 18 inch bar gets used very intermittently and for short times at altitudes ranging from 5000 ft to 12000 ft to remove downed obstacle trees (2\\"-24\\" diameter) while cruising 4WD back roads. Especially a problem in last few years with all the bark beetle dead trees in Colorado/New Mexico. A little PM wind will give you a few obstacles in your path in AM. One down tree in non yankable/winchable location needing an ax (forget that bs) or saw (hand saw-lazy-no way) can screw up your trip or make you take a very long reroute or force you to break out backup hatchet:( \\r\\n\\r\\nImpressed with M-Tronic ability to adjust for altitude/temperature to keep Unit running well.

The power to weight ratio on this saw is excellent in comparison to the Ranch Series saws of this size that easily weigh 1.5-3 lbs more and are made of a less durable polymer and case that\'s more difficult to rebuild/replace.

I\'ve worked on saws (not mine) that the customer complained about its running characteristics. Easy! Reset the system, let it retune itself, and more often than not it\'s good to go! Customers need to be aware too that when refueling BE SURE YOUR FUEL CAN IS CLEAN, NOZZLE IS CLEAN, AND AROUND YOUR FUEL CAP IS CLEAN. The solenoids have plastic internals and the grit that can get through the filter can over time wear out the solenoid. The M-Tronic system itself is FANTASTIC but I, as well as Stihl, knows that when something does go wrong, 99% of the time the solenoids are bad due to grit. However, thats hardly Stihls fault: the customer needs to keep dirt out of their fuel! We have been reassured they are working on a solenoid with metal internals that won\'t have some of the issues the current ones do. But don\'t let that keep you from buying one! Being a pro saw parts will be available for a LONG time and will be better quality than your homeowner/farm and ranch saws."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I purchased this saw to handle blow downs, general property maintenance, and I burn 20 full cord of wood/ year.

I would recommend The only complaint I have is the oil tank is difficult to fill from a gallon jug because of the handlebar placement."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Great saw with plenty of power. 20 inch bar perfect for all tasks."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I bought the MS 261 C-M because I wanted to stop lugging my 20 year old Stihl 026 between two locations. My 026 has been such a strong and reliable runner for the last two decades I didn\'t even consider saving a few bucks by switching brands. I didn\'t think the new saw could best my old favorite (which runs better than new) but, after three days of firewood cutting, I have a new favorite. The M-tronic engine is awesome! Anyone who claims the EPA is \\"choking\\" up new saws doesn\'t know what they\'re talking about. The 261 C-M bests the venerable 026 by much more than the extra couple of cc\'s would suggest. Particularly noticeable is the superior torque. When the saw gets deep in the middle of a big cut you can feel the torque kick in and grunt through without bogging down. This is high praise because my 026 regularly out-cuts every other 50cc saw I\'ve tried as it\'s a particularly strong runner. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe MS 261 C-M takes a couple tanks of fuel to enter it\'s element. The first tank I was concerned I had made a big mistake. The engine had disconcerting power variations in the middle of a cut and made me feel disconnected from the throttle. By the third tank of fuel, the engine was steady and powerful. I chalk this up to normal break-in process combined with the M-tronic brain \\"learning\\" and adjusting to the saw as it broke in. Now it cuts steadily and powerfully through the cut and has instant throttle response.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve run my MS 026 hard in demanding tasks for 20 years on 50:1 gas/oil mix (Stihl synthetic for 18 years) and it has been flawless so I plan to do the same with the new saw. Don\'t think you\'re doing your saw a favor by giving it a bit of extra oil. It only needs 50:1 and more oil reduces fuel octane and creates unnecessary and undesirable carbon deposits. The M-tronic engine adjusts for fuel quality so you get the full potential w/ the optimum fuel/oil mix.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting couldn\'t be easier. The M-tronic system allows you to start the saw exactly the same every time, hot or cold, low or high altitude, just push the lever to start and pull the starter cord (which has extra smooth action). It starts first or second pull when cold and first pull if a little warm or freshly hot. When it fires up, blip the throttle one time and it\'s ready to start cutting. The saw is equipped with a compression release but it is unnecessary on a saw that pulls this smoothly and easily so I\'ve stopped using it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new air cleaning system is quicker and easier to maintain and cuts an impressive amount of wood with minimal loading of wood chips. The centrifugal air cleaning system really does work.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can spend a lot less for a 50cc saw but will it be this good? No, it won\'t. This saw is light for a 50cc saw but has the cutting performance of many 60cc saws. And that\'s a big win in my book."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I have had many saws over the years and my Stihl\'s are my go to saws. (3) 250,311,390 are my past saws. I have cut down to just two.

If I did I would take it to my local Stihl dealer here in COLUMBUS NE. Reardon Lawn & Garden Equipment. They have great Service. Not that I NEED it because they converted all my power tools to STIHL !!!"},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I have only cut up one tree with this but it worked great."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"First, I’ll mention that this is the third piece of Stihl equipment I’ve purchased. I an say that I am proud of all the Stihl equipment I own, and when you can take pride in your work AND your tools, that’s a great feeling. \\r\\n\\r\\nI bought a home with about 3/4 of an acre of land that has a very mature landscape. My trees are mainly sweetgum and poplar with a maple and sycamore here and there. Last year I bought a BR 350 backpack blower and a FS 90R string trimmer. Both are at the lower end of the professional line of equipment and they have been the best pieces of equipment I own. I run the blower a lot more than the trimmer because of how many leaves I deal with! Its crazy! Anyway, I held off on a chainsaw because at the time I didn’t need one except to clear dead limbs and brush piles from the previous owner. So I bought a small electric saw from the hardware store and it got me by. It serves its purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now, I’m doing some thinning and clearing of the bigger trees. Plus, when tropical storm Irma (tropical storm by the time it got to my area in Georgia) came through, a few of my neighbor’s trees fell due to wind. The electric saw wasn’t up to the task, which isn’t its fault. It wasn’t made for this.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday I went back to my dealer and bought this saw, the MS 261 C-M with a 20” bar. I ran a full tank of fuel through it cutting mostly poplar trees and it made a believer of of me. It easier to control, it cuts faster, its oil system is superior, the antivibration system makes it a pleasure to use, and the M-tronic system is the neatest system I’ve ever seen on a small engine. Now, I was leery of the M-tronic stuff. I’m old school when it comes to that sort of thing and I believe that less is more in that regard. But when you buy from the best chainsaw manufacturer in the world, it has to be tough, right? Well, it gave me no problems whatsoever. None. When you start it you can hear it playing with the settings to adjust itself by listening to the engine. In a few seconds at idle, it is ready to go and man alive does it go! \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a homeowner, and you need to cut trees on occasion, the homeowner and farm/ranch saws are excellent as well. But if you have the resources, go to the professional line. I tried the MS 362 C-M as well and it’s just a bigger more powerful version of this one. For what I do, this 261 is way more saw than I need...today. Tomorrow that may change. Do yourself a favor and buy as much as you are skilled to use and can afford. You won’t regret it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for cleaning, I ran this saw for a few hours today and it was not nearly as gummed up with crud as my electric saw gets after cutting a stick! The chip control is so much better, the internals are so much better, the chain cover (magnesium by the way, not plastic) with captured bar nuts is easy to clean out...everything about this saw is engineered to perform. The quarter turn fuel and bar oil caps do not leak at all and they are easy to use with a gloved hand. \\r\\n\\r\\nProfessionals I’ve spoken to all hold this saw in high regard. And many have told me that this saw is their personal favorite because it’s powerful and lightweight and high quality. After using it today, they were right and I’m so glad this MS 261 C-M is my newest addition to my Stihl family. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will love how much you can accomplish with this saw. And the peace of mind you will have knowing you bought the best chainsaw on earth will be a feeling you get every time you grab the grips and take it to the field. Thank you, Stihl, for yet another excellent tool."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Owned some homeowner Stihl\'s and Farm/Ranch Stihl\'s which were good saws.This saw is far better as far as starting, idling, and could start performance.

That was the main deciding factor for me in model selection.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I have two \'cons\' to share:\\r\\n(1) it is much harder to start than I had hoped - especially in a machine that is supposedly designed for easy starting (re: the M-tronics and decompression button). Takes about 12 pulls for cold start (1-2 at full choke, until decompression button first pops out; then about 10 more pulls, at half choke again using the decompression feature.) Usually stalls then too, after initial cold start. But will start more easily after that. (So much for M-tronics!) Note too, that you really need to use that decompression button on this model. Else the pull is almost impossible - very stiff and jerky. Warm starts are very good - one pull only (at run position works best on my machine, not on half choke as expected).\\r\\n\\r\\n(2) I am also a bit disappointed in the manual - both paper copy received, and on-line .pdf versions I have found. They are pretty good in most respects, but lack sufficient detail for things like carburetor tuning. There is even confusion about whether the manual received is really for the machine that I have. Which manuals, and which text and pics in the manuals, pertains to the MS 261 vs the MS 261 C-M vs the MS 261 C-MQ is unclear.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would probably still make the same choice again. But my new owner experience, getting acquainted with and comfortable with this machine, is more involved than expected. Am still hopeful that Stihl quality, reliability, and usability will prevail, once I get more familiar with this particular machine."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Great saw, awesome power, Some good features. My only complaint is it is a hard starter. Can take 10 or more pulls to get it to start.. It would be nice to have a prime pump. something to get fuel to the carburetor. With the funny controls on the \\"start\\" control you never know where you are too much fuel or not enough. ."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I\'ve only had the saw a couple months and haven\'t used it much yet but so far seems to be a fine saw. It doesn\'t start as easy as i thought it would. Pulls easy but usually take 4-5 cranks to get it fired up when it is cold. Once it is warmed up it starts 1st or 2nd pull."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I didn\'t think I was going to keep the saw long when the engine stalled five times between cuts on the first tank of gas (dealer supplied fuel). The second tank the engine stalled three more times. The following tanks (gallons) the saw has run nearly flawless. The engine does stall when a significant change in the outdoor temperature occurs from the last use. It seems like the M-Tronic engine management system needs a few cuts to adjust to new conditions. With that said, I really like the M-Tronic engine management feature. I\'m not an engine mechanic, so I just want the saw to perform under all varying conditions. And, it does without any manual adjustments. \\r\\n\\r\\nI have a 18 inch bar and the engine is fully maxed when the bar is buried in a trunk of hardwood. All my thoughts of putting a 20 inch bar on this saw have vanished. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe greatest feature is its light weight. I have a small saw for limbing, but I have noticed that I use it very little now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second best feature is the decompression valve. Works very well and the engine starts easily. The button is perfectly located for easy and quick access. The engineers got this one right!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis professional saw is worth the premium price over other Stihl saws that cost less."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"when i first got the saw it just seemed a little under powered and sluggish, so i ran it for the break-in period and it got a little better with time. nut i was still not very happy with it, would stall with a 16\\" full comp chisel chain(stihl). so i opened up the exhaust and now its a amazing saw with plenty of power to pull a 20\\" bar and aggressively ground full comp chisel chain thru some willow( a soft wood to be sure but it HAULS through it). never had any issue with oiling so long as you keep it clean and seems to not wear spark plugs like a carb unit does. all in all its a powerful workhorse in a light weight package, that will start in 5 pulls no matter what, . would be 5 star but the lack of power out of the box was a little disappointing for a saw of this price. to sum it up it is a great saw for someone who was looking for something better that the 271 series and something lighter weight than the 300 series saws, basically something i can cut as much fire wood as i have gas for and something i don\'t have to deal with carb tuning issues."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"For 1-1/2 tanks of fuel this saw cut like no saw, including my old Stihl 026, I\'ve owned.

It would only start with the trigger pressed and it would want to run but just moaned. I just bought the saw two hours earlier so I called the dealer and they said to bring it back and they would swap out the fuel solenoid. They said there have been issues with the fuel solenoid and that was most likely the problem. Brought it in and the swapped the solenoid, mind you this is a brand new $589 saw that made one eight inch cut. Turns out the problem was not the fuel solenoid and the tech said the M-Tronic is not working. Thankfully they gave me a new saw and this one has worked just fine, for now...

First of all, they run really hot and have since their first major use. All the metal on the both saws have this iridescent sheen to it from heat. Even the little rubber piece the sprocket sits on melted. Second, the saw has problems starting. I\'m used to this from older saws, but brand new saw, no. The saws generally start up just fine the first pull and run well; however, once the saw is shut off it is really difficult to start again. It floods quickly too.

Next, I filled up bar oil and dealer oil/gas mixture. Would not start, waited half hour still would not start, waited another hour still would not start.

I\'d owned a Stihl before that I\'d purchased from eBay. I never had a problem with that one, but it was stolen. I\'d heard about the Stihl MS-260 from Wranglerstar on YouTube for years, so I took the plunge to buy it, knowing that as often as trees go down at my church, I\'d need a heavy duty saw. The saw worked fine through that tree, but then, later this year as we started preparation for our annual Youth Camp, it stopped running mid-cut. I took it in and was told there was a known engine problem. They said it would take six weeks to repair. I couldn\'t be that long without a saw, so I went ahead and purchased a MS 170, the humblest of all Stihl\'s saws. We were clearing new land for the church, so that little saw got a huge work-out, but it never quit. Camp prep took about four months, so I eventually got my 261 back. Put it back in service, and the same thing happened again after a few days. I took it back in, and this time they replaced it within a week or two. Brand new saw. I put that in service, and probably put thirty hours on it before camp prep was done, without a problem. Then hurricane Irma blew in and took out seven trees at the church. I grabbed my 261 and headed for the church. A tank and a half in to the first big oak and my saw stopped again. I took it directly to my Stihl dealer, then went and got my 170 to continue work. That is a work in progress, barely started, because fuel is scarce still here in Florida, especially the ethanol free, which is all I run in my saws. \\r\\n\\r\\nYesterday, I got a call from the Stihl dealer that Stihl had determined that my saw had been run \\"out of spec\\" because the chain on the saw was dull. I\'d sharpened it before I started on Tuesday as I always do, but I\'d put a tank and a half through it and I\'m sure it was getting dull when it quit. Sawing fallen oak is a tough job for a saw, which is why I\'d bought a pro model. I was told they would not honor the warranty. The head is cracked. I\'m heartsick about this total loss. \\r\\n\\r\\nI admit that I work my saws hard, but isn\'t the logical thing to do if you have a tough job to get a saw that is rated for tough work? Perhaps I\'m some kind of saw-killing nincompoop, but I never had a problem with the used Stihl I purchased used or the MS 170 I bought as a stand-in for my 261. I wish I\'d sprung for the next model up. I can\'t afford that now, and I\'ve lost confidence in the Stihl pro line.

I had a bunch of pecan wood to work up that will eventually end up in my smoker cooker. This saw went through all of it like butter and it was so easy to handle. I really liked the idea of no more filling it with fuel and when I was done with the job I just cleaned it up, put it in its case knowing that it would be there and ready to go for the next job. I no longer go out in the woods and cut several cords of wood and my saws no longer get the use that they used to.Now I leave them sit for long periods of time with out using them and when I do its always a hassle to get the gas ones going again no matter how much care I took in putting them away. ( my other saws are not Stihl ) maybe thats the problem with the gas ones. Although I have other Stihl equipment this is my first chainsaw.and I simply love it. It has more power than you would believe for an electric. Uses the same chain thats on a gas model the automatic oiler seemed to hardly use any oil, the tool less chain adjuster, and the fact when you let off the trigger the chain stops instantly are some really good features of this saw. There is not one con I could say about this saw except maybe for the price. It is expensive but when you get this saw in your hands and start using it you wont care that you had to put out the big bucks for it. The old saying you get what you pay for stands true for this saw. Hey, its THAT GOOD!! Thanks Stihl for a simply great saw!!!!"},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Had this chainsaw just over a year and operated it no more than 20 or 30 minutes. Today, it would not start. Took it to the dealer and he told me it was out of warranty. I spent well over $300 for no more than 30 minutes of cutting. Will never buy another Stihl product."},{"tags":["Difficult to Maintain","Difficult to Use","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Reason 1: Poor build quality. When brand new the trigger would stick \\"ON\\", causing the saw to unexpectedly keep running!! After a struggle with the local dealer (no, this isn\'t a \\"feature\\"!!) Stihl replaced half of the plastic housing because it was warped and caused the trigger to stick. This doesn\'t exactly inspire confidence in the saw. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 2: Poor chain design. Apparently a designer thought it would lighten the saw to drill a hole in each drive link in the chain. This nifty innovation causes endless headaches. During use, sawdust promptly fills each hole. As soon as the oiler saturates each little plug of sawdust the sawdust plug expands and becomes a highly effective little brake pad inside the bar slot. Multiplied by the number of teeth, these little brake pads work so well that the chain becomes well and firmly stuck in the bar and the motor has to labor just to spin the chain, let alone actually cut wood. It\'s as though Stihl never tried to USE this saw; such a design defect is infuriating and totally unacceptable. The only cure is to take the saw apart, remove the chain, poke out each little plug with a sharp object, blow the chain as clean as possible with compressed air, clean the bar slot for good measure, reassemble the whole works and hope to get at least half an hour of work done before it seizes again. Which it will. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 3: Poor engineering. The tiny chain tensioning knob is too small to provide enough force to tighten or loosen the chain, especially when the chain is sticking in the bar; see above. Also, the large metal sprocket which (theoretically, anyway,) actually tightens the chain gets clogged with shavings and won\'t turn. The only solution is to disassemble the thing, blow everything out with compressed air and re-assemble. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 4: The oil fill cap is plastic and overly complex. It feels like a matter of time before it breaks, rendering the saw completely useless. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 5: The oil reservoir is opaque plastic (i.e. completely non-transparent) so it is impossible to tell how much oil is in the tank. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 6: The mechanism that holds the bar on seems flimsy. It has plastic parts, a spring (?!) and fails to inspire confidence. Like the oil cap, I expect this to fail prematurely, rendering the saw utterly useless. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 7: No freewheeling. The motor lacks any sort of clutch or uncoupling mechanism so the chain can\'t be rotated by hand for on-the-saw sharpening. (To be fair, this may be common to any electric saw- I don\'t know.) It probably doesn\'t matter since the chain is perpetually bound in the bar anyway so moving it by hand is usually impossible. \\r\\n\\r\\nReason 8: Non-reversible bar. The chain tightening mechanism is designed such that flipping the bar over to distribute wear to both sides of the bar isn\'t possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese are off the top of my head. If the saw was in front of me I\'m sure I would remember another dozen reasons to hate it. (It drools oil constantly so I\'m not about to bring it inside the house.) I really wanted to like this saw. If the chain is freshly cleaned of sawdust brake pads, the motor generates plenty of power to cut through dry red oak. Excellent. Not having to deal with gas for short jobs is really, really nice. The saw is pretty quiet (quieter than my circular saw, far quieter than my gas chainsaw) and the neighbors appreciate that. However, in view of the above \\"issues,\\" I genuinely hate this saw. I regret buying it, I dislike using it, needing to constantly disassemble and clean it is incredibly frustrating and I dread even picking it up since I\'m always wondering what will happen THIS time."}],"proTags":[{"count":11,"text":"Easy to Use"},{"count":9,"text":"Light"},{"count":8,"text":"Easy to Maintain"},{"count":10,"text":"Reliable"},{"count":1,"text":"dont have to fuel"},{"count":1,"text":"always ready for the next job"}],"conTags":[{"count":1,"text":"there are no cons with this saw"},{"count":2,"text":"Unreliable"},{"count":1,"text":"Difficult to Maintain"},{"count":1,"text":"Difficult to Use"}],"rating":4.4,"starCounts":{"1":2,"2":0,"3":0,"4":1,"5":12},"secondaryRatings":{"Dependability":4.3,"Power":4.4,"Quality":4.2,"Value":3.8},"totNegFeedback":100,"totPosFeedback":428},"reviewCount":15,"reviewStarRating":4.4,"shortDescription":"A durable corded electric chainsaw with power to spare.","sku":"mse170","specifications":[{"name":"Voltage","value":"120 volt (60 Hz)"},{"name":"Chain Oil Capacity","value":"200 cc (6.8 oz.)"},{"name":"Oilomatic® Chain","value":"3/8\\" PM3"},{"name":"Guide Bar Lengths (Recommended Ranges)","value":"30 to 40 cm (12\\" to 16\\") <br />STIHL ROLLOMATIC® E"},{"name":"Powerhead Weight","value":"3.8 kg (8.4 lbs.)"},{"name":"Power Source","value":"Electric"},{"name":"Motor Output","value":"1.6 kW (13.1 amps)"}],"urlImage":["http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/mse170/50c498172da569ffe48f825cd80adc4c04fbd6070c6722c8fef249cb6804d57b/mse170-450-225.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/mse170/50c498172da569ffe48f825cd80adc4c04fbd6070c6722c8fef249cb6804d57b/mse170-250-200.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/mse170/50c498172da569ffe48f825cd80adc4c04fbd6070c6722c8fef249cb6804d57b/mse170-250-125.jpg","http://us04-arbo-rc.vs-networks.com:8000/images/mse170/50c498172da569ffe48f825cd80adc4c04fbd6070c6722c8fef249cb6804d57b/mse170-1000-800.jpg"],"relativeUrl":["mse170-450-225.jpg","/mse170-450-225.jpg"]},{"accessories":[{"sku":"chainoil","name":"Bar and Chain Oil"},{"sku":"cscarry","name":"Woodsman Chainsaw Carrying Case"},{"sku":"completefilekits","name":"Complete Filing Kits"},{"sku":"blkglass","name":"Black Widow Glasses"},{"sku":"grgripglvs","name":"Great Grip Gloves"},{"sku":"pmfh","name":"Pro Mark™ Helmet System"},{"sku":"prohivischap","name":"Pro Mark™ Hi-Vis Zip Chaps - 9 Layer"}],"category":"Electric Saws","features":[{"name":"Common Features for Chainsaws","pcId":125,"imageProcessFileName":"125","imageProcessUrl":"https://www.stihlusa.com/WebContent/Images/Features/125/Main.png?preset=Features.Main","imageProcessSourceImage":{"name":"source","format":"jpg"}},{"name":"Reduced-Emission Engine Technology - Caring for Nature","pcId":106,"imageProcessFileName":"106","imageProcessUrl":"https://www.stihlusa.com/WebContent/Images/Features/106/Main.png?preset=Features.Main","imageProcessSourceImage":{"name":"source","format":"jpg"}},{"name":"STIHL Quickstop®","pcId":529,"imageProcessFileName":"529","imageProcessUrl":"https://www.stihlusa.com/WebContent/Images/Features/529/Main.png?preset=Features.Main","imageProcessSourceImage":{"name":"source","format":"jpg"}},{"name":"STIHL Quickstop® Plus (Q)","pcId":426,"imageProcessFileName":"426","imageProcessUrl":"https://www.stihlusa.com/WebContent/Images/Features/426/Main.png?preset=Features.Main","imageProcessSourceImage":{"name":"source","format":"jpg"}}],"longDescription":"The MSE 250 offers professional-grade cutting power that is quiet, lightweight and durable.

Above all, it lacks power and will trip the overheat circuit frequently in light use on softwoods (pine). I double checked my power cord rating and it is correct. The saw has high torque on initial bite, but loses power and speed quickly as you let it feed itself. The overheat circuit will activate once every 9-10 cuts. I\'m not pushing this saw hard at all. The ergonomics are difficult to get used to and make using the saw awkward. There is one thing I do like, which is that you can roll your wrist forward to engage the chain brake without letting go of the saw grip. It is not particularly quiet either, I still had to wear ear protection. The design does not allow the shavings from the chain to exit the sprocket area/housing very well - this likely contributes to the heat issue.\\n\\nI\'m a Stihl fan (also own a ms311 + ms461), but this was a terrible purchase.

By far the best saw I have purchased to date. The MS 180 Mini Boss is a lot of saw in a small package. Mine has the easy to adjust chain tensioner roller that can be used wearing gloves. I like not having to have a tool to tighten the chain and this set up makes it a breeze and keeps you moving forward. This saw can handle whatever you throw at it. It\'s perfect for putting on a four wheeler or Side X Side on the farm and great for clearing trails. We use ours all the time and it always starts and runs like it should. Very reliable!!! This lil saw will make short work of most task. We use it to prun up bigger trees cut trails and when trees are down it has the power to take care of most of that too. We actually put a 16\\" bar on it and it has plenty of power to spare. Note: we ran it with the stock 14\\" bar for the better part of 5 years with no issues. We only switched to the 16\\" bar because we were removing some downed trees and pinched the roller on the end of the 14\\" bar in the process so we added the 16\\" bar as an upgrade to this powerhouse of a saw making it even better. But the 14\\" bar was fine until we broke it that\'s our fault not Stihl\'s. Just a great saw that works like you want a saw to work. Nothing bad to say. It\'s light it works every time and is easy to use. I\'ve had this saw for the better part of about 5 years and not once has it giving me any trouble that wasn\'t caused by me ( the bar issue). It has set in the shop for months on end in its case and when pulled out to use it starts right up.

I took er home to see how it would do sizing it up to the task of cutting down a hybrid ash tree in the front yard. For those that aren\'t aware, usually starting a two stroke takes alot of Patience, stamina and determination tending to evolve a personality of its own. I attempted to start it following the manual procedures, the first 3 pulls did not show me anything, she didn\'t even act like she was interested, so I tried a different approach and voila she barked, the next pull started right up. I cut the 30\\" wide tree down within an hour and starting whittling smaller branches, the Stihl didn\'t even breath hard leaving me pleantly pleased.

Next time I used it had basically the same issues after about an hour and a half. (Hard to restart, loss of power).Called Stihl to find out how I could get this addressed (under warranty). They said take it back to the dealer. I explained I had no intention of going back to that dealer and pay them to tell me nothing is wrong with this warranty item. A few trips to them would cost more than I paid for the saw. Their solution, take it to a different dealer (considerably further away than the first dealer). I asked if that dealer would be charging a fee to do warranty work and they say they won\'t. Well, since the other one did I have no confidence they won\'t.

I trimmed trees as a side business. The saw was cheap and did everything to cutting from small branches to entire trees. It spewed bar oil everywhere. Never did it not start. I decided to buy a \\"good saw\\" now that I have a good job and a house with lots of trees. So I bought this saw. I used it ONCE before so I decided to buy a new chain because I was going to cut 4 small trees and do some trimming. So the saw struggled all day to cut down the trees. Half way thru I had to buy another chain due to time because the new one I was using was smoking. Luckily that did the trick. But I must say I have done big jobs with my old poulan and Oregon chains never had to stop and re sharpen. Also it would bog down every once in a while but not like the Stihl.

Cleans out the garage, cleans the driveway, blows leaves and REALLY blows snow. I clean my 150 ft hillside walk and that of 3 neighbors in everything but the heaviest wet snow. It\'ll clean a concrete sidewalk down to dry bare concrete. Little need to salt and sand and we live on a pretty steep hill. I find it even more irreplaceable in the winter and because of it\'s snow moving capability I have a neighbor buying one. For me, it makes shoveling obsolete and I\'ve never bothered buying a snowblower and live in Wisconsin.\\nVERY reliable. I run only Stihl oil in it, flip the carb setting between seasons per the manual and change the air filter as needed. This year after 7 years of running it, I took it in and had the valves adjustment done at a Stihl dealer just as preventative maintenance. I expect this thing to keep running many, many more years.

Was going to go for the BR 450 but for $50 more, couldn\'t pass this one up. It\'s actually lighter than the 450. Easy controls and starts right up.

Just about every professional landscaper and groundskeeper praised it\'s power and reliability, it\'s ease of use and low maintenance. I decided to follow their suggestion and buy the BR 600 and, boy, am I glad I did.

My home is surrounded on four sides by forest and in the past raking the leaves was a dreaded fall task. We usually had to rake a minimum of two or three times to keep the accumulated leaved from killing our grass. The BR 600 has turned that task into almost fun, and certainly a task not to be dreaded.\\n\\nThis blower is so powerful that it even sends walnuts and hickory nuts flying. I\'ve even blown mice and chipmunks out of their holes and sent them flying through the air! Even when the leaves are piled up high and thick, this blower will move them easily. When raking, I used to have to drag the leaves in a tarp, way down into the woods to dump them so that they wouldn\'t blow back into the yard. Now I just blow them where I want them to go, even down through the woods. It used to take two of us working most of the day to rake and haul our leaves. Now, I do it by myself and it only takes a couple of hours. The BR 600 Magnum will save you a HUGE amount of time compared to raking.\\n\\nAnother thing I really like about this blower is that it\'s very fuel efficient. I\'ve never run it out of fuel before I finished a job. This year, I\'ve started maintaining the grounds of our Church and Vicarage. I use the BR 600 Magnum to blow grass clippings off the sidewalks, curbs, steps and patios after mowing, and it\'s much quicker and more effective than sweeping.\\n\\nI really like the backpack blower as opposed to the hand held blowers I\'ve owned because it\'s MUCH more powerful and LOTS more comfortable to operate. I had shoulder surgery a few years ago and can no longer operate a hand held blower for more than a few minutes at a time."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"CFM is key. I have handled 4 other hand held style gas blowers over 20 yrs or so and the last 16 years on a heavily wooded property. Bought the 600 just prior to leaf season here in SE Michigan in September 2014 and I am extremely pleased with this power tool, I wonder why I didn\'t buy it sooner. I also bought the Stihl gutter kit and use it to clean gutters- which are tough to do from the ground but this thing makes short work of it. Regular blowing on grass, patio, decking, sidewalk, driveway, and cul de sac is absolutely stellar. I finish the work in 1/4 of the time it used to take with hand blowers. It seems to be easier on my arms and back than hand helds and my stature is ave and thin. Power is great and it starts on 1-2 pulls everytime. Have owned a Stihl 025 chainsaw for a long time, about 17 yrs, it is also a great tool. If a truly great power tool is needed pick a Stihl and also pick a model more powerful than you think needed, you likely won\'t be disappointed."},{"tags":["Light","Easy to Use"],"reviewText":"I first purchased a bg 56c-e hand held blower .

IT Makes short work of a yard full of leaves and grass."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I live in the woods on 10 acres of maple, beech, oak, ash, and black cherry. Moving leaves in the fall is a major task, and very time consuming. I\'ve used rakes with tarps, electric hand blowers, gas push blowers, and even the neighbors tractor and pull behind vacuum. I love the fall, but always dread the leaf cleanup job. My wife bought me the BR450 for my birthday to help me out. . I knew that the 600 Magnum existed; so with my wife\'s blessing, I returned the 450 before even using it, and upgraded to the 600 (in my world, big is good, bigger is better).\\n\\nThis machine is exactly what I\'ve needed. It clears dry leaves fast and easily - doesn\'t matter how big or deep the pile. It literally scours the lawn for twigs, acorns, wet leaves, and anything that isn\'t staked down. The lawn is about 1.5 acres in size, and I can move all the leaves, both front and backyards, in about 90 minutes. This used to take me, at best, 5 to 6 hours. The job includes blowing them out of house corners, flower beds, rock gardens, and under decks; and then 10 yards into the woods. I\'ve even used it to clear eave troughs. By the way, it works well on cold snow (vs the heavy, wet stuff). I blew off my sidewalk and concrete pad in front of the garage that had 2-3 inches of new stuff - just make sure you\'re going with the wind!\\n\\nI\'ve had no trouble starting the blower, 1 or 2 pulls and she takes off. The tank holds enough for me to almost finish the yard, that\'s at full throttle for about 75 minutes. The only change I would make to the machine is adding a cross strap across the chest area. I use a short rubber strap with hooks; it works just fine.\\n\\nCompared to all the other methods of clearing leaves, this is by far the best. If you\'re like me, there\'s always one tool that you\'d hate to do without. This blower is it."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Just bought this blower few hours ago and have only used it a total of 20 min. I\'m blown away at just how strong this thing is.

This blower has the velocity needed to send leaves & needles rolling. The key to this blower exceeding the others is in the smaller diameter tube. This design provides for increased velocity at the nozzle. Plus, the smaller diameter tube is not clumsy like the larger ones on the BG-450/700 models. The larger tubes are more-easily damaged & hard to extend from the telescoping collar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BG-600 has an optional nozzle that is curved so as to facilitate blowing close & parallel to the ground. This is particular useful in getting large quantities of wet leaves or needles to roll away. It lessens the need for stooping over while operating. I recommend getting one!\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those living in snow country, this blower is outstanding in removing powder snow from sidewalks, driveways, decks, autos, overburdened trees, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree with other reviewers about the need for a breast strap to prevent the shoulder straps from sliding off, but that is an easy homemade fix."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I brought the br600 1yrs ago love this blower.

In the 23 years I have lived there, the bane of my existence is that from late October to early December, these trees shed literally tons of leaves on my roof, my lawn, and surrounding driveway and carport. In order to keep them from accumulating to the point that my domicile does not resemble that of a Hobbit from the Shire, I have to blow them to the surrounding field every few days. - Too many years ago to remember, I purchased a Stihl BG 75. Though I have probably not taken care of it as I should, it has been a champ. As long as I don\'t wait too long between sessions, it\'s done a great job of taking care of the leaf problem. Unfortunately, living in Oregon, there are many years that it rains for weeks. When this occurs, even the stalwart BG 75 needed some help in the form of a scoop shovel and several wheelbarrow loads to deal with the soaked detritus piled high all over and pulpy sheets matted by my vehicles\' tires. This is just such a year. And as a certain actor from a certain action series if fond saying: I\'m getting too old for this... Yesterday, I went to my local Stihl dealer to see if I could get the BG 75 some help; Enter the BR 600 Magnum. This bad boy has the air velocity that reminds me of watching the Saturn V blast the Apollo spacecraft to the Moon when I was kid. It took me about an hour to learn how to control its power and direct things where I wanted them to go, but after that, it was like slicing butter. Leaves were wet and ankle deep, many ground into the asphalt, and it started to pour rain halfway through the job; it did not matter. - My handheld still has its place for clearing off the roof and for delicate jobs. But to get the bulk moved quickly in challenging circumstances, I believe I chose very well. In this review, I cannot attest to the dependability of the unit as I just started using it (though it started on the second crank when first fired-up, then the first after that). But based upon my prior experience with Stihl products, I have no doubt that it will continue to exceed my expectations for years to come."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Overall I love this blower!

However, I made it fine and although it is tiring to carry, it is much less stressful than the handheld system I have used for years.

I rationalized that blowing the pine straw and leaves into my yard islands would take less time and physical work than raking, picking up and distribution.\\n\\nThe very first time I pulled the crank my brand new BR600 started and in a little less than two hours my one acre lot was as clean as if I had vacuumed it. It took me all day a month earlier.\\n\\nHowever, the initial use experience was enough to convince me to go to the www and order a sternum strap to add to the harness of my BR600 backpack blower.\\n\\nWhile the unit is relatively light, no matter how loose or tight I adjusted the harness straps, I could not get the load on my back into a comfortable position and keep it there. As I moved the wand left and right the unit moved and I found myself constantly hanging onto the left strap to keep it somewhat stationary.\\n\\nMy research into what products serious backpackers use (military & recreational) I found two backpack manufacturers frequently mentioned, Maxpedition & Mystery Ranch. They have Sternum Straps that can be easily added to any backpack product (e.g. Sprayers especially with pump handles) that both help support and stabilize the load being carried on a persons back.\\n\\nI subsequently ordered one from both as I also have a backpack sprayer who\'s harness is afflicted with the same short coming as my new Stihl backpack blower.\\n\\nAfter reading all the reviews, I can\'t say if other backpack manufacturers have addressed this sternum strap issue because I did\'t consider any brand other than the best.

Dealer provided a great service and I brought unit home fully assembled and even with some gas. With that I got synthetic oil (extended warranty). Blower starts at the first or second pull. Power is amazing and low weight with low vibration and moderate noise are appreciated. Entire season I did leaves myself (1.2 acres) and I think this blower just about payed for itself. I like to buy the best and take care of my stuff. On the end of the season blower is still like new. Ergonomics is great and while I have no basis for comparison with this being a first one, it is great. One thing that I would do or change is to provide sternum strap and bar tacked flat strap sewn on top of the straps. That could be an add on option and I would gladly spend an extra $10 or so to get it. Without it shoulder straps do slide from my shoulders, so I had to furnish my own and that worked out great.

It was a little heavy and cumbersome to lift on my back at first, but once I figured how to lift it properly at low throttle it became easier. I recommend the belt accessory if the weight feels too much on your shoulders. Haven\'t quite got the shoulder straps adjusted properly yet since it feels like it is slipping down my arm sometimes. The price was a problem at first, but considering all the time and money I\'ve saved by doing the clearing myself, it feels like a bargain. It\'s definitely designed for the big jobs.

This rig is loaded with power and will blow the hair off your neighbors head if you point it in thier direction. It starts very easy every time and has power that will simply amaze you. I also use this to blow leaves off my roof and clean my gutters (which it works excellent for#. If you want to know how superman feels, buy one of these units, strap it on your shoulders and go to work. I have to laugh as I watch people try to blow leaves with a hand held electric blower. If only they knew what they were truely missing out on!! Since it only requires your right hand to use after being started and strapped on. I normally drink an adult beverage or two and blow leaves at the same time. Multi- tasking has been taken to a new level. This makes it even that much more enjoyable anyhow. I used to cringe as I watched leaves fall #as it took me multiple entire weekends to rake). Now, when the leaves start falling the only factor that concerns me is if I have a few cold drinks in my fridge."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"Good Blower with good power, however it could be much better if Sthil made improvements to make it easier to put on to hold the straps together so they do not slide off your shoulders.

Fortunately my 029 AV is continuing to do a good job, so I was emboldened to again roll the dice on a high price point Stihl br600 machine. So far, through just one leaf season here in Vail, CO, I am glad I did. The power is a marvelous step up from its electric predecessor. Now I\'m the boss, not the leaves. I can\'t quite figure out the harness - I just end up using the right strap. But the work is a newly passive experience - you are merely called upon to point, and the work is done.

With 40 acres and a one half mile driveway in the woods this leaf blower moves leaves, wet or dry, loose or piles and even the small fallen branches that my other leave blowers wouldn\'t move. Stihl 2 cycle mix has kept my chainsaw going so I\'m using it in the BR600. Throttle control is good and blow force is easily controlled for each requirement near foundations, bushes and tight spots. The motor is on the loud side, even using ear plugs. Starts easy, idles great. Will blow dry leaves for 30 - 40 feet ! The power is amazing and will push you backwards if you let it. Down side is that the unit seems unbalanced during use. During use it tends to be heavier on the right side as you wear it. Tends to slip off your right shoulder as you use the right handed blower control. Maybe it\'s the combination of weight, centrifugal and centripetal forces. Annoying and tiring. Adjusting the shoulder straps doesn\'t seem to help, short of tightening enough to cut off your blood supply. Come on Stihl, come up with a fix.

Its now the only tool I use to clean the bed and inside of my work truck, roofs, and overgrown edges with packed in dirt(aside from the weed-eater to cut out the edge). One of the best things I\'ve found about this blower is when I have a yard that needs a leaf clean up, and the customer\'s previous lawn maintenance crew would just mulch the leafs with the mower leaving behind seasons of acorns wood bits composting leafs and half decomposed dirt. I am able to get the current seasons leafs up in a flash and with only a fraction of the time a rack would take, I can almost completely clean up the left over scraps and nuts from previous seasons!

The initial tank which was about 20 percent depleted was then refilled with the suggested mid level octane and Stihl fuel mix purchased from the dealership. So again it worked fine for about 20 minutes then began to lose power again then stalled. For a third time I refilled the tank and it lost power again after about 15 minutes which obviously was quite frustrating.

I could not get it started a couple of days later. I took it to the shop and they told me because it was more than 7 days old that they could not just switch it out with a replacement. Apparently the shop where I bought it told me they took it apart and the rod was sheared in half. They also told me that they called stihl and they said that this is a fairly common problem.

There is a front mounted knob on the BGE71 but with the thrust of the blower the BGE71 fatigues your wrist much faster. Also I like the curved discharge outlet more than the straight one that comes standard on the BGE71. I will be buying that as an attachment for my new blower.

Put it to choke or you can squeeze the trigger a little bit while starting and it is good to go. \\r\\nPower revs up quite fast and is responsive to throttle and also drops back down to idle nicely even when dropping from full throttle quickly. It has a strong fan and blows quite a nice flow of air and the throttle is very controllable at all speeds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be great if it would include a flat nozzle which apparently is not an option and also a strap which would help for longer periods of time. Left handers would get their pants sucked to the grille although still comfortable with the left hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is also good about this blower is that you get an extra year warranty with the purchase of motomix fuel or oil. \\r\\nAnother reason as to why I went with Stihl was that the dealers are conveniently locatated compared to other brands for servicing and parts if needed.

This was a great investment. I chose the BG 56 over the BG 50 because even though the same size engine, this one has an automatic choke and easy-pull cord, which makes it very quick and simple to get started. I love a throttle so I can vary the airspeed, something I couldn\'t do on the electric blower- makes it very easy to throttle down to idle to blow out the plants around the house without causing them any damage. I can also now easily carry this on the roof to blow it off and quickly clean out my gutter. Also, I haven\'t bought any attachments but the BG56 also accepts different nozzle attachments, which will be my next purchase. While a little heavier than the electric, it is well balanced and easy for me or my wife to use. I was also surprised to find that I can blow off my whole yard on one tank of fuel- even though the tank is small this thing barely sips the fuel. One thing to be aware of is that the air intake is on the right-hand side of the engine, so if held in your left hand and you hold it close to your body you might suck your pants up to it.

Not sure it\'s worth the hassle. Blower works very well - good air volume and speed. Better than the $100 big box store blower.

Have to open the gas cap and let it sit to relieve vapor lock."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Bought this unit from a particular dealer that actually opens the box and runs the machine before they sell it to consumers. Not sure thats a Stihl thing or just a dealer going above and beyond for customers. Although I\'m impressed with that kind of quality control, They set the idle way too low. The blower would drop down to a really low RPM and almost stall when you let go of the throttle. It was so low, that in order to get any kind of throttle response, and spool the engine up again, I had to stand there and burp the throttle a few times to get it to spool up go wide open throttle again (this is after it was warmed up btw). A simple adjustment to the idle screw fixed the issue and I was very pleased the rest of the afternoon. A few occasions I could hear the engine running rich under wide open throttle, but it leaned out after a few seconds and went back to normal. High speed jet screw probably needs to be backed off a hair. I\'ll let the warranty address that issue if it becomes a recurring problem. Blower is very quiet compared to my old Echo PB1000 , tons of compression, but relatively effortless to pull start. This thing doesn\'t blow the fastest, but it moves a whole lot of air, which makes the most sense when it comes to blowers, I\'m more impressed with CFM, rather than MPH. Those who are searching for a machine based on air speed will be uprooting half their lawn trying to blow leaves. Based on air volume, this is a strong machine. Too soon to report any long term reliability issues. But I\'m anticipating some tuning issues being a problem over the long haul. Doesn\'t mean it\'s a bad product, I\'d buy another one in a second, but I\'d ask the dealer to start it in front of me before I left the next time."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Needed one badly but could not see why I needed a backpack model so this was what was left.

This blower is close but with a few glaring flaws, less one if you\'re right handed. I\'m not, and using the blower in my left hand causes my shirt or pants to constantly be sucked over the air intake cover so I either have to hold it uncomfortably away from my body or change hands. The other \'problem\' is, once warm, when you throttle up from idle it tends to bog down, it\'s more of a nuisance than anything. Keep in mind the dealer fine tuned it prior to handing it over to me. \\r\\nNow for the positives. From the start, buying a Stihl is like no \'big box\' experience. The sales rep and owner of the store talked me out of buying the commercial blower I initially wanted based on my needs, saving me a little over $100. Then three people reviewed starting, usage, and warranty issues of this item during the sell. Doubling the manufacturers warranty using Stihl synthetic oil is another great benefit. And the fact I can return it for service or warranty issues to my local dealer is a huge plus. It starts easily and is lighter than my previous blower (great for getting on my roof), although not quite as powerful- it is more than adequate for my needs. \\r\\nAnother factor in my purchase is the carburetor allows fine tuning of low and high speed adjustments. Although it should be years before I need this feature (and is intended for use by Stihl technicians), I have two blowers in my shop from reputable manufacturers that essentially require you to replace the carb instead of allowing me to compensate for eventual wear, i.e. flooding. Hence the reason two 6 year old blowers sit broken in my garage. I know Stihl wants reviewers to stick to the subject at hand, but for me, this forms part of the decision-making process and hence one of the reasons I bought this product. A huge positive if you tend to keep lawn equipment for the long term.\\r\\nAfter a lot of research and questions, it seems to me there are just a few high quality lawn care manufacturers left. Several of those have chosen large scale marketing (big box stores) over quality and reputation. So my choice came down to 2 brands, but the competitor had such limited dealers (and even fewer service centers)- I was not willing to travel 2 hours to buy (or service) it. Now I cross my fingers I made the right decision, but if their products are good enough to put on our fire trucks, they should be good enough for my garage."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I like that the suction side is positioned for right hand users.

I\'m not sure why, but there is no way to lock the throttle on for extended use and the suction port has a vented cover that allows the suction to catch your pants when using the blower left handed. Minor issues, but annoying at times. The main issue I have with this blower is that it does not start if it has been sitting in freezing weather. Every time I have taken it out to blow away snow, I\'ve had to let it warm up in my house for a half hour. Once it\'s warm it starts on one pull.

Another week or so passed and finally received a call and was told more parts needed to be ordered and that it was not covered by the warranty. I asked if he knew or had an idea as to what caused the damage. The repairman said that it was most likely caused by improper mixing of the oil and fuel. Did I mention I purchased the Stihl oil and by doing so that it extended the warranty out to two years. I followed the mixing instructions and I only mix a gallon at a time so it does not sit for an extended period. I even shake up the jug again prior to refilling the tanks. So I asked how much to repair the blower, the price was more than it was to buy a new one. So here is my question to Stihl? Why do I bother to purchase the Stihl oil and extend the warranty if a service tech can simple say it was operator error and the repair is not covered under warranty? So I now wonder how long it will be before my Stihl chainsaw, weed eater, or backpack blower will go through the same ordeal.

The issue is that I bought the blower for my house. I’m 74 years old and work around my house for clearing leaves almost daily off my small driveway. Unfortunately..... the blower after 1 year the blower became harder to start ... even bought the motor oil from STIHL to ensure I had the best performance. Keep in mind that I have had a few blowers over the last 30+ years and never had problems until my ECHO gave up after nearly 10 years. Anyways I wanted to give STIHL a chance since I use their trimmer for my yard. After I took the STIHL blower to be looked at by a service technician... I was told that the unit is not under warranty because it was used “commercially use”. This is strange as I’m a senior citizen and veteran as well that simply blows leaves off my one car driveway. I went to get another opinion and was told “you can’t mix with ethanol in the gas”. This explanation is puzzling as all gas sold at the pumps (at least where I live in Virginia). I am having this “repaired” at a STIHL service center and it has now been two weeks... I understand that it is Christmas and today is New Years Eve... so it would cause some delay.

I totally get the concept of the easy start system. I did not get it at first. You literally barely have to pull the cord; it is almost comical how softly you NEED to pull the cord. If you pull slightly harder than what you are supposed to, you will be either taking it back and having it serviced i.e. replace the spring mechanism that is absolutely necessary for you to start this piece of junk or you will be replacing the spring yourself. It only takes about 15 minutes to replace the spring but I have a pile of about 5 or 6 springs that are slightly stretched due to pulling slightly too hard on the string. The first 2 NO Doubt were my fault and I quickly learned that you have to be EXTREMELY delicate when pulling the cord. The last 3 or 4 are ridiculous! I want to get rid of this thing but I definitely do not want to fix it again and sell this to someone; it would be unethical. Do Not Get anything from Stihl that has the words Easy Start or you will be replacing springs. Now that I know how to pull the Easy Start the springs still only last for 2 or 3 uses."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"I never expected such a unreliable peice of equipment as this bg

I was used to being tethered to the house outlet as I pulled and un-knotted the cord the whole time I was working with it. I got up on the roof of my ranch house and had to connect two (2) 50\' cords together. When I was up on the roof blowing out the gutters my dear wife could hear me let out an occasional expletive because either (A) my knotted up cord was caught on a bush or a porch railing down below or (B) the end of the cord slid down the roof in order to escape being connect to the back side of my electric leaf blower. I\'ve thought about it and I think the two pieces had a personality conflict. After another visit to my local Kimp\'s Ace Hardware, I saw the end-aisle display as I was walking through the store. I thought to myself, THIS GAS POWERED STIHL LEAF BLOWER iIS THE ANSWER. No longer do I have to babysit the two pieces of cord and electric blower. I\'m Done!

My opinion is largely based on a comparison with that older blower. I\'ve used the Stihl for a couple of months now and only with the \\"flat\\" nozzle. This unit is effective at all tasks for which I\'ve used it. It starts exactly according to the instructions. When first started, it lacks power and runs a little sloppy until it warms up, then it runs beautifully. It is remarkably effective at moving long, stiff pine needles across the grass. I anticipate good performance on fallen leaves. I make fewer passes for a given area and can move material at longer ranges. It takes some care not to move topsoil under some conditions. It\'s great at blowing off the lawn mower, including under the pulley guards on the deck. Some magazine reviews call Stihl blowers loud, but I always use hearing protection with lawn equipment, so this is not relevant to me. I miss having a shoulder strap and may have to invent some way to add one. The Stihl seems a little thirsty or may have a smaller fuel tank, but that is subjective. It\'s easy to fuel and didn\'t spill when briefly overturned in the SUV. It\'s a bit unstable when riding in a trailer or vehicle. This is one of the few gas tools I\'ve used that locks the throttle at a true wide open position. When I use the blower in my left hand the suction inlet pulls my pants or jacket on to the grill, limiting air flow. A good sign, but I have to keep this in mind when using it left-handed. I purchased a less expensive model of another brand before this one, then read the reviews and returned that one.

Quite a bit more expensive and no military discount or sales. Stihl has the name and your neighbors will be more impressed with your Stihl but won’t know for awhile whether the signifiicant price difference is worth it.

My buddy has one of these and it\'s great, maybe I just got a Friday model. 5 to 6 pumps on the primer and 5 to 6 pulls to get it started and runs rough after that.

Once carb is replaced two cranks into trying to start it the flywheel shears the key off and just spins freely. Dead blower. Ah no biggie I’ll just get a new flywheel. Until I found out a simple flywheel is $90 and like $110 if dealer installs.

Then one day I\'m blowing off the front lawn of my client. I then shut it off and placed it in the shade to cool it off. About 30 min went by and was going to blow off the backyard. Well to my surprise it would not start! I did everything you could thing of, took off the air filter, choke on/off, full throttle. Nothing!! Now Mad! So I had to use my Honda Mower HRX217 to blow off the backyard. Honda saves the day!!\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that I took the blower to the Sthil dealer. They gave it back to me 1 week later. I knew they didn\'t fix it. So as soon I as I got it. I started it and blew off the front of the dealership. LOL!!! for 15min and sure enough it would not start as soon as if shut if off. So I gave it back to them. They looked at and pulled the filter off. Nop. No start! They keep it another week. They replaced the Carb and gave it back to me. Same thing happened. Gets hot, won\'t start. \\r\\n\\r\\nWell I took brought it to my garage and found out the nuts holding the carb and housing were lose. I\'m thinking this caused a gasket to take in air or leak out fuel. I tighten them up. It works. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I\'m scared to shut it off. Fearing it will not starting up. I need it for the job! So now, I turn it on and blow off the front yard and keep it idling until I blow off the backyard. I don\'t look forward to the day I have to do 2 or 3 lawns at different houses. If this one goes out, I\'ll buy a BR600.

I\'m not sure how I did it now. I bought an old electric blower from the thrift store a few weeks ago to install on a large sander I have for wood working in lieu of a dust collection system. I plugged it up and the wife saw it working and had to use it. She blew off the deck, the patio, the slab in front of the shop and the carport. And she did it week after week.\\nSo, as an Early Christmas present \'joke\' I told her I\'d bought her this Stihl leaf blower (I actually just bought it for any of us). I don\'t think I\'ve ever given her anything that made her smile more, she was like a kid with it. She fights over it with the daughter!! If I had known this, I\'d gotten one years ago. She keeps all the leaves off everything and I use it to blow out the shop and blow the leaves out of the gravel driveway. It has truly been awesome. So good, in fact, the daughter wants her own.

I was undecided as to the BG 56-C and the BG 86 C-E, so I emailed Stihl technical support and they responded quickly and thoroughly to all my questions. The added features of the 86C-E (especially, the antivibration, the comfort grip handle, and the easy to use throttle lock lever) and the inclusion of the flat nozzle were selling points on the 86 C-E. I needed power to blow the leaves off my stone landscaping and my landscaper showed me how to hold the 86 C-E parallel to the ground and sweep across the stone to keep from blowing the gravel out of the landscaped area. If you have gravel, this blower might be too strong (per my experience and Stihl technicial response to me.). The easy start feature was a necessity for me. I bought the Stihl Ultra oil 6 pack to double the warranty and per another reviewer bought BP 93 octane gas, I understand some Marathon stations sell ethanol free gas and if I can get that for my next gallon, I will.

It does take 3-4 pulls on a cold start which kind of surprised me. I was thinking it would start like a Honda lawnmower...one pull and it\'s on. It does not do that but does start right up after 3 tugs consistently and I can happily manage that. It was expensive but good quality always is and in the long run I will easily make my money back.

The trees are highly valued by me, but their downside is the amount of cones they drop every year (Fall/Winter). These cones are long, cylindrical and somewhat soft compared to true pine cones, which are more bulbous, larger and tough. Consequently, the fir cones tend to get embedded in the grass where a lawnmower doesn\'t pick up most of them, and raking is also difficult. Bottom line: The shredder/vac feature works GREAT for picking up Doug fir cones. However, (and speaking from experience) DO NOT use the shredder/vac for picking up tough PINE cones, as they are way too tough and will jam the machine and break off the plastic fan blades (fortunately, a replacement fan is inexpensive and a DIY-job)."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I was replacing an older Stihl blower that I let the hot muffler come loose and weld itself to the plastic housing.... This one has good power, is quieter, they kept the air intake on the right side away from clothing and the vibration dampening works like a charm.

Sept to late Nov. Since purchase the carburetor was replaced twice under warranty, the muffler bolts have loosened off twice (my repair and parts) and I just brought it in to find out the bottom aluminum casing has cracked allowing the engine mounting bolts to loosen and the engine to seize. (The unit was not dropped). This is a very expensive piece of garbage. I take care of all my power equipment and use the correct oil and additives per specifications. I may have received a lemon but my wallet has had enough. I have two weed whackers, 2 snow blowers, lawn tracker all with many more hours and all perform well.

After being shut off and sitting for 10 minutes or more, the bulb will not fill with fuel no matter how many times you push it. The blower must cool down first, then the bulb will fill with fuel and start within 2 pulls and run perfectly! I can\'t afford for it to cool down in between jobs.

The Lithium-Ion battery-powered BGA 100 is built with the professional landscaper in mind. When in boost mode, the BGA 100 is the most powerful dedicated handheld blower in the STIHL range. This Lithium-Ion battery-powered blower boasts higher quality and better ergonomics than many other battery products on the market, and delivers performance superior to many gas powered models. The new BGA 100 design shifts the battery weight from the unit to the back or hip with a high-performance cable connecting system. This results in a lighter blower and reduces user fatigue. The BGA 100 features four performance levels through a variable speed throttle trigger delivering an even balance of blowing power and run time. Its rear-mounted air intake allows the blower to be used right- or left-handed. The quietest and lightest blower in the STIHL lineup, the BGA 100 allows you to clean up with ease around neighborhoods, urban areas, or other noise-sensitive zones. Run time may vary based on battery type, charge level and capacity, model, operating style and conditions. Batteries and chargers can be purchased separately or as a combined set with tool.

My guess is that on full power, you\'d have maybe 10-15 minutes. That\'s with the big battery, which I bought.

The Lithium-Ion battery-powered BGA 100 is built with the professional landscaper in mind. When in boost mode, the BGA 100 is the most powerful dedicated handheld blower in the STIHL range. This Lithium-Ion battery-powered blower boasts higher quality and better ergonomics than many other battery products on the market, and delivers performance superior to many gas powered models. The new BGA 100 design shifts the battery weight from the unit to the back or hip with a high-performance cable connecting system. This results in a lighter blower and reduces user fatigue. The BGA 100 features four performance levels through a variable speed throttle trigger delivering an even balance of blowing power and run time. Its rear-mounted air intake allows the blower to be used right- or left-handed. The quietest and lightest blower in the STIHL lineup, the BGA 100 allows you to clean up with ease around neighborhoods, urban areas, or other noise-sensitive zones. Run time may vary based on battery type, charge level and capacity, model, operating style and conditions. Batteries and chargers can be purchased separately or as a combined set with tool.

My guess is that on full power, you\'d have maybe 10-15 minutes. That\'s with the big battery, which I bought. But here\'s the thing, you\'d never need full power when you use this guy anyway. during normal usage, I\'d guess you\'d have about 30mins useage, but that\'s a guess. Of course with the big capacity battery. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing though, I might have purchased the BGA85 simply due to the fact that you don\'t have to wear the battery belt & cord which is not as convenient.

Thanks Stihl."},{"tags":["Easy to Maintain","Easy to Use","Light","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I\'ve been mowing my lawn for over 10 years. 5 years in a cold climate and now 5 years in sunny South Florida. I always hated dealing with the oil and gas of a traditional mower but never wanted to sacrifice the power for a battery mower or deal with a long cord on a plug-in. That is until the 510 came out. My local repair shop and Stihl dealer - Joe Blair in Miami, FL - had one on display. I actually had my gas mower in the shop to deal with yet another carborator problem and seeing the 510 on display got me thinking... no more specialty gas to buy (I only used rec fuel), no more oil changes, no more carb repair bills. The math worked. I bought floor model and couldn\'t be happier (shout out to Dave Sr. For his help and advice).\\r\\n\\r\\nOk, now to review the 510. First, it\'s very easy to use and light to push around. I used to use a self propelled gas mower and dont really notice a difference in effort with the 510 even though the propulsion is 100% human. Even with a full bag it\'s an easy push. Nearly 80% of my hour and half of mowing is spent on \\"Eco\\" mode which is plenty powerful to handle my St. Augustine grass. My yard is between 3,500 and 5,000 sq. Ft. And at the end I have about half a battery left. Oh, and I have to mention how quiet it is. Its hard to tell in the store because over a solid surface the noise is amplified but once you get over the yard it\'s incredibly quiet - you could easily carry on a conversation while mowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve only noticed two downsides. 1.) in Eco mode the power is a little light so some grass blades dont get sucked up verticle to cut, so I end up going over about 10% of the lawn a second time to get a clean cut. 2.) I used to use my mower as a vacuum after edging but again the eco mode just doesn\'t have the oomph to suck up the dirt and clippings from the sidewalk... so with the half a battery I have left after a mow I use a brand new Stihl blower to clean up.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall it was a great purchase - highly recommended!"},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light"],"reviewText":"I have a small city lot that only takes 15-20 mins to mow.

I did lots of reading on the Internet about \\"electric\\" lawn mowers and even consulted Consumer\'s Reports. When I felt sufficiently knowledgeable (being able to ask intelligent questions) I contacted a local business who suggested I look at STIHL. I\'ve only mowed twice so far with my RMA 510 but I\'m in love with it right from the start.\\r\\nEasy to push and maneuver, lighter than my gas mower, much quieter (I no longer wear my earmuffs) and good for the environment. I both mulch and bag grass clippings. Taking out the mulching device is simple and easy. The suction power using the bag is amazing. The bag is almost always completely full when I stop to empty it and the bag\'s size and configuration make it so easy to empty. Raising and lowering the wheels is also extremely easy with the one lever. I\'m impressed with the power of the mower and the life of the battery on a single charge. It also does not take long to recharge the battery. On my first mowing I had areas with pretty tall grass and the mower just ate right through it. The mowed area appears very even when done. The mower will slow down if the grass is tall and thick with previous growth. I don\'t want anyone to think you can go out and mow a tall thick pasture with this mower. Being 64 and having a bad back it\'s a dream to push a button and pull a lever back to start the mower! At this point I have nothing bad to say about this mower. My one suggestion would be to add a sensor that alerts you when the bag is full.

I made the purchase and have just finished my first mowing session with it. My lawn is a little more than 1/2 acre and I am 69. Although I don\'t see th posting for my earlier review, I would like to make some comments regarding other postings, which can generically apply to any of the Stihl products. Most of the negative comments I have read pertain to the RMA370 not being able to do something for which it was not intended to do. As an example; the instruction manual states that it is not suitable for tall or wet grass, yet some reviewers have listed that as a complaint. How does that apply to this review? Use the right product for the job. When I bought my RMA370, it was the only battery operated mower Stihl made. I knew it had a narrow cutting path and that it would take multiple battery charges to cut my entire yard. I knew to mow frequently enough to not let my lawn get too tall, because the RMA370 was not designed for it. Knowing those limitations, I see no reason to fault the mower. As soon as I found out that the 21 inch RMA510 was available, I knew it would be much better suited to my needs. Now for my review of the RMA510. It does what I expected, by providing an even cut, which is what any homeowner wants. The AP300 battery far surpasses the run time of the AP180 battery. A plus is the fact that my 3 AP180s will also power the RMA510 and the AP300 will power my 4 other Stihl devices (chain saw, edger, hedge trimmer & blower). Is the 510 heavier - absolutely, but that is to be expected of of mower with a significantly wider cutting swath. The steel deck adds a great deal of weight over the non metal deck of the RMA370. The lighter 370 deck has never chipped or cracked, despite stones hitting inside. I wish the 510 decks were made of that lighter material to make it more manuverable. As long as you have a fairly level yard, even if you are an elderly wimp like me, the 510 is manageable. The only other suggestion I would make is for Stihl to offer the same type of blade (\\"ninja\\" type, with the split on each end) on the 510 as is an option on the 370. Although a \\"mulching\\" blade comes with the 510, it does not have the split at the end of the blade which makes grass clippings very fine. Such fine clippings eliminate the need for bagging and leave no grass clippings behind the mower. Again, this assumes you are not going to let your grass grow too long. Regarding cost. Yes, the initial cost is relatively high compared to a 21 gas mower (spare battery needed if you will follow mowing by using other battery powered devices such as the blower), but no gas, oil, spark plug or other maintenance is required. Plus you are getting a very high quality, reliable product. Very happy with my new purchase of the RMA510."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I am a 74-year-old woman who likes to stay active in my yard. One day the starter cord on my gas engine lawnmower was finally too difficult to pull. Stihl to the rescue! Now I just drop a battery into a slot, push a button and away I go. My RMA 510 is much quieter and easier to manage than my old mower, easily cutting about 1,500 square feet on only half a charge with one and a half bags of clippings. The only improvement would be a self-propelled mode to help on slopes."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I find the concept of lawns inherently repulsive and mow my back yard expressly to keep ticks and burrs off the cats, so I\'m not one to find Zen in the art of routine lawnmower maintenance. This means I really only ever consider electrics, and consumer-grade electrics aren\'t really built to last more than 6 months--including Stihl\'s older, smaller models--so I usually try to spend as little as humanly possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen I saw the 510 and thought it might actually be worth investing in, so I found a dealer that had one (easier said than done in my neck of the woods) and tried it out. The motor is insane. Even in my mess of overgrown weeds and blackberry brambles, it\'s so close to the power of gas that I can\'t imagine anyone other than a professional landscaper really missing much there. It\'s not the easiest thing in the world to maneuver, but it\'s not going to wear you out for the rest of the day, either. I can do two passes of my yard (often necessary when it gets too tall) on half a charge, so I personally have no use for the extra battery storage compartment, but I can see it being handy for larger properties. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt shuts off almost immediately if you hit something solid--like a chunk of old fencepost--and there\'s no clumsy reset procedure to go through to get it running again. Just make sure the blade\'s clear to spin and switch it back on. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy biggest complaint is the fact that there is nowhere to safely grab the thing by when it\'s time to put it away. The handle folds down for ease of storage, which is great because I throw it in a big plastic deck box thing, but it doesn\'t lock or latch down in any way once collapsed, so lifting it up into said box is far more difficult than it really needs to be. I may just bolt some stainless steel handles onto the deck myself because it\'s such a nightmare. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I\'m pretty happy with my purchase. I\'m surprised Stihl isn\'t pushing these on dealers more than they seem to be as it\'s leaps and bounds above their older mowers in just about every way, yet nobody\'s ever even heard of them."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"Great mower with my medium size yard I can get an entire mow and trim with my electric STIHL trimmer that uses same battery and charge to spare.

I\'m glad that it was a gift, and that I didn\'t buy it.\\r\\nThe pros: Very easy to use, and there is no gas or oil to fool with.\\r\\nThe cons, and I\'ll try to keep it short: The battery doesn\'t last long, especially on ECO mode! I have about 3,600 sq. ft. to mow, which takes me about 45 minutes, and the battery dies halfway before I am finished. That is on ECO mode too! Two people that reviewed this mower stated that they mowed about 1,500 sq. ft. in a 1/2 hour, and only had about 1/2 the battery life left after they were done. That seems about right. So why do the specs state that this mower can do about 5,100 sq. ft. on a single, fully charged, AP300 battery? I had my boyfriend come out and mow, and he had the same problem. He swapped out the battery with a new one, thinking that it was a bad battery, and still had the same problem. Now he did slow his walking speed down a little because it didn\'t seem like the mower was cutting the grass well in ECO mode. It left some blades of grass uncut. Another con I have is that it isn\'t self propelled. Now if it was, then I am sure that the battery life would be even shorter. Now I have two other Stihl products that I love, but this one falls short. I\'ll still keep buying Stihl products because of their quality, but will think twice when it comes to their battery line."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"Can u turn this off to save battery?

I am a Stihl snob. I have owned more than 21 Stihl products and this is the first and only one I have ever been disappointed by until now. Every other product has worked amazingly until the Stihl 510 mower I just purchased. After my gas powered non-Stihl mower died after 15 years of hard use I thought I would try this Stihl electric mower to reduce noise and air pollution. I have never been so disappointed with a Stihl item, in fact I\'ve never before been disappointed until now. I\'ve used it a half-dozen times in order to make sure my first impression was correct and it is. This mower is not ready for prime time. Although the battery lasts long enough for a medium size lawn and the mower is indeed quiet I do question it\'s ability to stand up to even medium duty use. It is of course lacking self-propel to help the battery last which means it is only useful on lawns with minimal slope. This mower is very low strength which means it is difficult to tell where one has or hasn\'t mowed unless the grass is of relatively tall height. It will only lift leaves if they are light and on the surface of the grass which means I now have to rake first or use my Stihl leaf blower before mowing to remove leaves from my lawn as this mower will not clean them up..it barely disturbs most of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo where would this mower actually be useful? Perhaps for teaching children how to use a mower since it is light and quiet? Perhaps for an elderly person who really wishes to mow their lawn if its small and contains no leaves? Its really more a Barbie mower for light use or pretend usage. Perhaps you might consider purchase if you live in an area where gasoline is non-existent for illegal or where you cannot store gasoline indoors. Otherwise, this mower is a major disappointment and I cannot recommend it to anyone except a young child or an older person or perhaps for cleaning up around edges where large mowers cannot. I wish I could return this item and purchase a mower that can do the job my old gas powered mower did.

I already had batteries and charger from a previous purchase of a Stihl pole saw which works great and I needed a saw which could handle the difficult cuts of a large hardwood tree trunk over and over. The MSA 220 C works great. Fast cuts. No cranking. No cussing. It works every time. 300S battery time is approximately one hour of continuous use. The battery depletes much quicker then the HGA65 pole saw due to the larger motor and higher torque. But it cuts great!! And no cussing. No cranking. The cons are the battery compartment does accumulate wood chips and debris and the saw will perform as long as the saw is kept fairly clean. Occasional disassembly of the chain cover is needed to clean the area. It seems to clog inhibiting proper operation."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Light","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"As a lifelong Stihl chainsaw owner, the older I get, the harder the saw is to start.

In my twenties, I worked at a logging company where I used a 066 all day every day felling and topping trees, until we switched to the MS 660. I also upgraded my personal saw during that time to a MS 021, which I still use today. \\r\\nI then got into landscaping, where I used and purchased all STIHL equipment (edgers, trimmers, blowers, etc.) also had an array of chainsaws for storm cleanup. \\r\\nAll that to say, I have a lot of experience with STIHL and have never found a better brand out there. So, when I was in the market for an electric chainsaw to use at home for my woodturning hobby, again I went with STIHL. \\r\\nWhile I was very skeptical about the functionality of a battery powered saw, my wife and neighbors made it clear that running my gas saw at home was no longer an option. So after weeks of research, I pulled the trigger on the MSA 220C with the AP 300S battery. This thing chewed up anything and everything I threw at it. Plenty of power and descent run time. Obviously I wouldn’t take it out to fell and top a bunch of trees, but for my needs it is a perfect saw."},{"tags":["Easy to Use","Easy to Maintain","Reliable"],"reviewText":"I bought this saw thinking it would be great for small jobs around the yard.

I did a lot of chainsawing, but I had lots of trouble starting the chainsaw. Then I got a MSA200 battery saw with 14 inch bar 5 years ago. It was great. But March 2021, I also bought a MSA220 with a 16 inch bar. This latest saw is a game changer. Advantages: chain is significantly larger than MSA200 chain, and the MSA220 cuts 10 inch logs much more like butter. The larger chain takes a better sharpening too. Of course, with a battery operation, (1) the saw is much less noisy than a chainsaw, and (2) it always starts with the push of the tandem two switches. The power rivals that of the gas-powered Stihl chainsaw I used to have. I got one of the AP300S batteries with the new purchase, and this new battery does last a little longer than either of the two AP300 batteries. Perhaps I can cut 10 ten inch diameters logs with the new saw with one battery. Since my chainsawing is done in 15 acres of woods behind my house, I go out with the MSA 220 first with the AP300S battery, and then while that battery is charging, I resharpen the chain and then go out carrying both of the AP300 batteries.

That being said, I have always liked Stihl products and I have been extremely interested in a battery powered KM unit. I tested out a KMA130 but didn\'t like the idea of using a belt-style battery system that plugs into the unit. Once this unit came out with the swappable on-board battery came out I knew I wanted to try it and now I finally have a couple weeks under my belt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile on paper it doesn\'t have the RPMs on my edger and trimmer than my KM130 had, the torque this guy packs is insane. Normally I would have to \\"work the ground\\" while edging for the first time and the 130 would sometimes skip a little in rough conditions. The KMA135 ripped right through even on power level 1. The trimmer works great in this respect as well. Personally, I feel like the blower works just as well as it did with my 130 although on paper I know it doesn\'t blow as hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite thing about it is the variable power level. When doing light trimming around the house, power level 1 was plenty and it helped conserve battery. When I needed more, I could bump it up. Regardless of level, I never felt like any attachment was underpowered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne negative I\'ve found is run time. A full AP300S won\'t outlast a full tank of gas in my KM130. Even then, the charge times are quick enough (I splurged and got the AL500) that it isn\'t too much of an issue. This technology is still relatively new and I feel like it will only improve going forward. My hope is that while battery technology improves, Stihl keeps compatibility with older product.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other con to this unit is weight.

If I had any complaint it would be all the safety features that makes this trimmer a little awkward to use at times.

I recommend the HSA56 highly.."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I live in the Los Angeles area. I need to trim my hedges two to three times per year. My gas hedge trimmer would not start [again]. Probably the gas went bad [again]. I get tired of adding new gas with oil and using only a portion to trim, and then storing the gas only to see it go bad months later [again]. And I do not want another corded electric tool. So I investigated the battery trimmers. On special sale, I purchased the FSA56 string trimmer and the HSA56 hedge trimmer and therefore got two batteries and chargers. I didn\'t think the hedge trimmer would hold up to the gas powered trimmer but it does. It is easier to use, lighter, and cuts just as well if not better. Having two batteries allowed me to run for a long time and I still had half-power left in the second battery when I was done. Stihl, you made a believer out of me for battery powered tools."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I brought this a couple weeks ago to trim different shrubs. Works great but a little heavy."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"This is my first hedge trimmer, so I do not have a lot of experience with them. I went to the Stihl dealership because my research indicated battery-operated hedge trimmers have come a long way as far as operational charge and how long the charge lasts, with Stihl being rated very highly. I\'m glad I did. My HSA-56 lasts 40 minutes which is plenty of time for both my front and back yard hedges. It cuts them like butter, so its got the power I need without the hassle of the power cord dragging around. The bottom of the trimmer is flat and so the hedges do not get caught on it. This trimmer is about medium weight with the battery inside, so cutting will wear on your forearms a bit after a while. Lastly, the battery meter is right in front and shows you how much charge is left. For example, if the indicator appears half way diminished on the meter than you have approximately 20 minutes left. The safety mechanisms on it are going to ensure you won\'t lose a finger, so while you may gripe about them always understand they\'re there for your benefit."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"This is an excellent product.

I took that to mean \\"over winter\\" type storage. Since then I have seen other places on the internet that the blade should be cleaned after each use. The Stihl brand resin cleaner is really expensive though. Like I said in the last review it is a good little trimmer just know that you may have to use this cleaner every time you use it.

I was excited to get it, having been impressed with Stihl ads I\'ve seen in Time magazine and on tv. However, it doesn\'t live up to the hype about the battery length of use. I certainly didn\'t get 9 football fields of cutting out of it. It was great for trimming small stuff like dead stems of sedum, small clumps of ornamental grass, and yard shrubs. However, when I took it to cut serious ornamental grasses our Garden Club has planted at one of our beautification sites, it just didn\'t have the umph to do the job. The battery died so much sooner than I expected, and the cutting power was so-so. Luckily, I had also taken along the Stihl gas trimmer, on my husband\'s advice, and it was good that I did. The battery powered trimmer is good for light to medium yard work, but it\'s not the \'serious\' trimmer I expected to get to do serious jobs. It\'s lightweight, it starts readily, but it IS a true light weight tool for light weight jobs."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Last summer I bought the HSA 56 and used it several times over that summer. I was impressed with the power, runtime, and ease of use. I oiled the blades, removed the battery and hung it up in the garage until this summer. When I went to use it this summer the blades would not move, there was just a “click”. The great thing about Stihl products is the dealer network. I took it to where it was purchased and had it repaired free of charge. The good thing is Stihl backs its products, the bad thing it failed in less than one year. I recommend this product with reservations."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"After reading all the glowing reviews I purchased this trimmer. In my experience the battery lasted 50% of advertised. After trimming 1 and 1/4 battery charge the trimmer locked up. I took it back to the Stihl dealer and there was no easy fix, i.e. blade jammed. Stihl wants it repaired and will send the parts to the dealer, sometime. As of this writing it has been 8 days since they were ordered but still nothing. I guess it is not uncommon for it to take quite some time for Stihl to honor their warranty. I heartily regret purchasing the battery operated unit. Any twig larger than my little finger gets gnawed on, not cut. My other Stihl products are great, but they have a gasoline engine. The battery operated hedge trimmer, not so much."},{"tags":["Heavy","Unreliable"],"reviewText":"Jams ALL the time on tiny twigs!   Does not produce fast blade movement and jams very easy.

Also, battery does not last long at all when the whole blade is engaged in cutting.   For the price I would keep looking for a better battery trimmer."},{"tags":["Unreliable"],"reviewText":"My first product \\"locked up\\" after the first or second use.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the Stihl RMA 460 had the rating I wanted and was competitively priced.\\r\\nIt was easy to set up and performed great for my yard. The dual battery set up is nice for a bigger yard and saves having to schedule the yard over two sessions. The deck is real metal and the wheels, hardware, etc. all feel solid. The motor is strong and quiet and the machine is light enough that pushing it never feels like work.\\r\\nI\'m in Alaska where August is a wet month and that can be a problem when daylight is still 18 hours a day. If you miss a week, the grass can be tall by the time you return to it. With my old mower dead, I waited 3 weeks doing my research on this mower. Given this, the grass was 6 inches or more and there was an underlying wetness. The Stihl 460 handled this tough job with no complaints. I started bagging and then gave it up and switched to side eject. That\'s the only real downside to this particular mower: the fairly small bag size (about a bushel)...Having said that, I think it will be fine for the weekly mow."},{"tags":[],"reviewText":"I needed a new mower and had been shopping around for an electric one.\\r\\nThe Stihl 460 fit my needs well.\\r\\nI was amazed at how lightweight it was and how easy it was to use.\\r\\nUnfortunately, my lawn is just large enough that I can\'t complete it on a single charge, and waiting an hour or more for it to recharge and finish kinda sucks.\\r\\nI\'ll have to buy a second( rather pricey) battery to be able to swap out and keep mowing.\\r\\nThis is easy enough to do, but I notice several other brands come with 2 batteries with purchase of the mower, which in my opinion just makes more sense.\\r\\nOtherwise I\'m pretty happy with it and have been showing it off to my neighbors."},{"tags":["Heavy"],"reviewText":"I had wanted to get rid of my gasoline powered lawn mower and other implements.

Stihl claims is will go roughly 2800 square feet on the included AK30 battery. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy quality rating is based on the mover top getting scratched heavily by running it under a hydrangea.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy dependability and power ratings are based on the battery taking in excess of 6 hours to charge. That charge lasted maybe 20 minutes with the wheels at full extension to leave the longest grass. If I can\'t run it, it\'s not dependable.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy value rating is based on this: After buying I found out that it is a 36V system, which given the fact that I found an 80V self propelled system from another company for $150 more. Stihl is clearly underpowered. I ran that one for 40 minutes and the power meter on the battery still reads full. It is rated to mow more than an hour and by experience I can say it fully charges in less than 2 hours. \\r\\n\\r\\nI am very thankful that Scott McClendon\'s Hardware in Belfair took it back after I had it for 7 days.

The freedom the battery brings means that I have blown my deck off much more frequently. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe biggest negative is the weight of the battery on your wrist.

The unit does deliver the advertised CFM. While not as powerful as a gas blower it does come very close. I have both the AK20 and AK30 batteries and found the run time close to what they advertise; about 15 minutes with the AK20 and about 25 with the AK30. What I wish I had know before purchase was how the throttle/trigger worked. It\'s just an on/off switch. You either have 0% or 100% power. I, incorrectly, assumed that since it had a trigger it would operate like all other blowers allowing you to adjust the amount of power but no. It also has two safeties that have be disengaged in order to pull the on/off switch. It\'s a blower, why do I need so many safeties? I was also disappointed to find out there is no way to mount or hang the blower when not in use. There is not eyelet for a hook, or mounting bracket, or way to store the unit other than sitting it down."},{"tags":["Difficult to Use"],"reviewText":"Bought this chainsaw last week.
